[Two Cueball-like guys stand together as a young guy dressed up with small ears and a tail approaches.]
Cueball: Oh God, a furry. Don't let it touch you.
[The furry hears someone call out to him.]
Off-screen: Hey, kid.
[Megan is seen preparing a kite to be flown.]
Megan: Forget those assholes. Come help me.
[The furry begins to help Megan set up the kite.]
Furry: Thanks. So you're cool with furries?
[The two are now standing far appart the furry with the kite and the line going over to Megan.]
Megan: Well, I think your fetish is weird as hell. It just bothers me how you're this designated Internet punching bag among people who are otherwise down with weird fetishes. So I stick up for you when I can.
[The kite now successfully up in the air and Megan pulls the line with both hands moving backwards.]
Furry: Well, thanks. I owe you one.
Megan: It's no big deal.
[Megan stops some distance from the fury holding the line with one hhand. The fury lift one hand up apologising.]
Furry: No, this is like the lion and the mouse.
Megan: ...Listen, can we pick a comparison less likely to turn you on?
Furry: Sorry.
