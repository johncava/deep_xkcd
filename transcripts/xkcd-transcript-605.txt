My Hobby: Extrapolating
[There is a graph. Time runs along the horizontal axis; Number of Husbands on the vertical graph. Yesterday and today are labeled in time, 0 and 1 in number of husbands. Points are plotted with 0 at yesterday, 1 at today. A straight line is fitted through them.]
[Cueball is holding a pointer to the graph, and looking at Megan wearing a dress and veil.]
Cueball: As you can see, by late next month you'll have over four dozen husbands.
Cueball: Better get a bulk rate on wedding cake.
