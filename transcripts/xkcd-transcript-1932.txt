"Auto-" - Greek meaning "self."
"Meta-" - Greek meaning "after," "beyond," or "in reference to."
"Logo-" - Greek meaning "word" or "speech."
"Lex" - "lexis" is another Greek word meaning "word"; but in this case it is more likely to be a shortening of "lexicon" (another word for dictionary), or perhaps a reference to the process of "lexing" (lexical analysis), part of the process of computer analysis of text.
