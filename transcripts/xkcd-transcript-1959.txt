[A black frame containing a table of two columns and three rows, mostly in grey. The columns are titled 1990 and 2018, the rows are titled Lisa, Bart, and Homer & Marge. Lisa & Bart's ages now, as well as Homer & Marge's age in 1990, are in black, surrounded by a black jellybean-shaped loop visually grouping these three entries together.]
