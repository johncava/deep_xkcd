[Megan and Cueball standing outside their en-Phelps-ified swimming pool.]
Cueball: Why is Michael Phelps in your backyard pool?
Megan: I don't know. He's been there all day. 
Michael Phelps: Woo! 18 gold medals!
[Megan and Cueball break out a pair of pool nets and unsuccessfully try to snag Phelps.]
Cueball: Can you get him?
Megan: He's so !
Phelps: Ha hah! Can't catch me!

[Cueball heads off to fetch something.]
[Cueball returns with a hand truck full of Jello mix.]
Phelps: Oh crap.
