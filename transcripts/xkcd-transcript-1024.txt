[A guy sits at a computer, while a friend takes a book off a shelf behind him.]
Computer guy: "Error -41"? That's helpful. It doesn't even say which program it's from!
Friend: -41? I'll look it up...
[The friend looks at the book.]
Friend: It says -41 is: "Sit by a lake."
[The two walk.]
[The two sit down.]
[A large, in-color painting of a lake with pond lilies.]
[The two are still sitting.]
Computer guy: I don't know where you got that book, but I like it.
Friend: Hasn't been wrong yet.
