When an earthquake hits, people flood the internet with posts about it-some within 20 or 30 seconds.
[A room with a desk, chair, and computer are shaking. The person in it is on his phone, using Twitter.]
 Huge earthquake here!
Damaging seismic waves travel at 3-5km/s. Fiber signals move at ~200,000km/s.
(minus network lag)
This means when the seismic waves are about 100km out, they begin to be overtaken by the waves of posts ABOUT them.
[There is a geographical border on a map; the front edge of the wave of the quake is shown, with the front edge of the wave of tweets surpassing it.]
People outside this radius may get word of the quake via Twitter, IRC, or SMS  the shaking hits.

Megan: Whoa! Earthquake!
Sadly, a Twitterer's first instinct is not to find shelter.
Megan and Cueball (on phones): RT  Huge earthquake here!
