[A sign sits by a well.]
The Uncomfortable Truths Well
[A Cueball-like guy and Ponytail are lined up for the well; the guy throws a coin in.]
Well: For a universe that's supposed to be half Chinese, Firefly sure doesn't have any Asians.
[The guy is gone, Cueball and Megsn arrives as a couple lining up behind Ponytail; Ponytail throws a coin in.]
Well: There's no solid evidence DVORAK's better than QWERTY. The standard histories are urban legends.
[Just the couple remain; Cueball throws another coin in.]
Well: You've never said "I love you" and meant it. It was always just words.
[Megan has presumably also thrown a coin in the well. This is not shown as for the first tree. Cueball waits for her on the other side of the well.]
Well: You meant it every time.
