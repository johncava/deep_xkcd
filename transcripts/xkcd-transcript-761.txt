[In a frame that breaks the top of the first panels frame:]
Preparing for a date:
[Hairy with wet hair and a towel around his waist thinks with his hand to his chin. There are four situations, but it is not possible to read the fourth line.]
Hairy: What situations might I prepare for?

[Close-up on Hairy's face, who is still thinking.  There are again four situations, but again it is not possible to read the fourth line.]
Hairy: Okay, what kind of emergencies can happen?

[Zoooming out again to full figure of Hairy. He is still thinking... There are four snakes, but again it is not possible to read the fourth line. The word Danger stands beneath the three dots above the "?" after each snake.]
Hairy: Hmm. Which snakes are dangerous? Let's see...

[Hairy is sitting down in a chair with a laptop in his lap, while still wearing the towel.]
Hairy: The research comparing snake venoms is scattered and inconsistent. I'll make a spreadsheet to organize it.
[Bottom panel is larger than top four, and aligned to right. Ponytail meets Hairy on his front stoop. She is carrying a purse, and looks down at the towel he is still wearing. Hairy holds his arms in the air.]
Ponytail: I'm here to pick you up. You're not dressed?
Hairy: By LD, the inland taipan has the deadliest venom of  snake!
