[Miss Lenhart is standing in front of an image, presumably a temperate Venus, with greenhouses, grass, flowers and a river flowing into a sea.]
Miss Lenhart: Venus once was temperate. It had seas and rivers, and Venusians cultivated vast fields of beautiful flowers.
[The image is now zoomed out to see the entirety of Venus, with continents and oceans. The greenhouses are shown fleeing ("running") away from Venus.]
Miss Lenhart: Until their greenhouses fled the planet due to the runaway greenhouse effect.
[Miss Lenhart is now standing in front of a classroom and addressing the students, we see one of these Science Girl with her hair in a bun, sitting at a desk.]
Miss Lenhart: The Venusians pursued their greenhouses to Earth, settling in the Netherlands and kickstarting the Dutch floral industry. Any questions?
Offscreen student (presumably Science Girl from previous panel): Because you're retiring in a month, do you just not care what you say anymore?
Miss Lenhart:  I  atop a screaming bird of truth! Also, yes, I do not.
