[Two people are standing together, Megan and Cueball.]
Megan: Will you marry me?
[Cueball throws his hands in the air excitedly.]
Cueball: Let's find out!
[The couple are now standing in front of an altar. A flower arch stretches over the couple and a person is standing behind the altar. Megan is wearing a knee length white dress and a veil. Cueball is wearing a bow tie. They are holding hands.]
[The couple stand together, still dressed from the wedding and still holding hands.]
Cueball: Apparently, yes!
