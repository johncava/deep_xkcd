[Split screen down the diagonal. Upper left: A man with only hair around his neck is standing to the left of a desk with a hand on it, speaking on an office phone on the desk. There is a photo in a frame behind the phone. Bottom right: Death in a cloak, black hole to the left where the head should be, speaks on cell phone he is holding up in his skeleton hand.]
Man: Death?
Death: Speaking.
[A frame-less panel with a zoom out of the man on the phone, showing more of his office. Behind the desk there is a potted plant and above it a window (or a white board). The reply over the phone is indicated to come from the phone with a zigzag line.]
Man: This is the boss.  Where  you? You haven't been up to the office in days!
Death (over the phone): I've been held up.
[Full panel with Death speaking on his cell phone. It is apparent that he is leaning back again something white behind his back. The two replies on the phone are again indicated with zigzag lines.]
Man (over the phone): What happened?
Death: You know how when someone dies, they can challenge me to a game for their soul?
Man (over the phone): Sure, standard procedure.
[Death is revealed to be sitting on a chair to the right of a table leaning back against the chair's backrest (which could be seen in the first two images of Death as well). He is still speaking on his phone and in the other hand he holds his long scythe down with the blade below the table. On the other side of the table is a man (revealed to be Gary Gygax in the title text).  The man has curly hair that seems to turn into a ponytail, but as he is looking out of the panel a little to the left away from Death it is hard to see the ponytail. He also has a full beard. Gary Gygax is leaning over his bag behind him taking out a book while resting the other hand on the table. On the table are already two other books of the same type. Behind them are two figurines (one Cueball and one with a pointy hat), then two dices and paper strewn about in front of Death.]
Death: Well, we didn't count on this guy. I might be a while.
Gary Gygax: I add the paladin to my party.
Death: Oh, Jesus. He's getting out  rulebook.
