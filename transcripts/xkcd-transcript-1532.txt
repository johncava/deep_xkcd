[Cueball and Ponytail are standing in front of a large computer console. Cueball's hands are on the keyboard; both are looking at the screen.]
Cueball: We made it! After all these years,  is finally revealing the surface of Pluto!
Ponytail: Take ,  team.
[In the next four frames, we see photos, entirely black except for a circle in the middle. The circle is initially small, indistinct and appears in shades of grey. Successive circles are larger showing more color and shade variation. In the last, we see a blurry but recognizable outline of Africa, the Middle East and part of Western Asia, along with some clouds. The lighting pattern suggests that it is daytime in Africa, sometime in the northern summer.]

Cueball: OK, who did the calculations for the Jupiter slingshot maneuver?
Ponytail: (facing away from the computer console) Dammit, Steve...
