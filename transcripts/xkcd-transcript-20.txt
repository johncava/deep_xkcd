[A color drawing of a ferret with airplane wings and tail on it.]
[Cueball and his Cueball-like friend (to the left) are talking.]
Friend: Why on earth did you make those wings? You don't seriously think they could let your ferret fly, right?
Cueball: I... of course not.
[They continue to talk.]
Cueball: That would be pretty dumb. It's just, uh... ...a Halloween costume.
Friend: oh, okay.
[They continue to talk. But now the head of the ferret can be seen to the far right on a table.]
Friend: Besides, who would want a pet to fly anyway?
Cueball: Yeah. Pretty lame, huh?
[The friend leaves the frame while Cueball stays. The ferret cannot be seen,]
Friend: Anyway, let's go play video games.
[Cueball stands behind after his friend has left. He looks back towards his Ferret which can be seen more clearly this time standing on the table.]
[Cueball imagines ferret flying over the ocean near the beach using his makeshift wings. The imagination is in color]
