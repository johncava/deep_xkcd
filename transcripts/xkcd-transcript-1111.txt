[The setting is a standard entertainment newscast. Hairy as the news anchor in the studio sits behind a desk, resting his hands on the desk, starts off the segment with an inset feed to the right where Megan can be seen in front of a crowd behind her. The title of this segment is shown below the feed.]
Hairy: All Hollywood is in town for tonight's star-studded premiere! We go live to our reporter on the red carpet. 
Hairy: How do things look?

[Megan switches to full-screen. Megan is standing in front of a full crowd of Cueball heads who are behind a line held up be sticks, one of which is visible behind her. She holds a large microphone up to her face.]
Megan: Bleak. 
Megan: In 800 million years the aging, brightening Sun will boil away the oceans, and all this will be blowing sand.
[Switch back to initial framing with Hairy moving his arms further away from himself and Megan now with the microphone visible.]
Hairy: Oh. Um. ...Sounds pretty grim. How are the stars reacting?
Megan: Hydrogen fusion. But it won't last forever.
Hairy: I mean the  stars.
Megan: They won't last forever either. None of us will.
