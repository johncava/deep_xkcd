[Megan is kneeling on the floor, playing a card game.]
Megan: Hah! Welcome to Suckville-population: .
[Cueball is sitting on the floor opposite her, also playing the game.]
Cueball: Why are you using 2000 census data?
Cueball: That's an old figure.
[Megan turns around from the game to look at her laptop, which is sitting on the floor behind her.]
Megan: I couldn't find Suckville in the 2010 census.
Cueball: Huh? It's right there in SF-1 table P1.
Megan: Oh. So it is.
[Megan turns back to Cueball, who is looking at his cards.]
Megan: Well, then. Welcome to Suckville-population: 83.
Cueball: Much better.
