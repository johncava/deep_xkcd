[Black Hat is sitting in an armchair, with the right arm on the armrest and looking at his smartphone held in his left hand, when a voice from behind him (off-panel left) addresses him. It turns out in the next panels that it is Cueball.]
Cueball (off-panel): Your movie folder is so . Where do you find all this stuff?
Black Hat: Dunno.
Black Hat: Around.

[Back to Black Hat sitting in the chair as in the first panel, but leaning a bit further back and the arm on the armrest has been moved closer to him.]
Cueball (off-panel): 
Black Hat: It's pretty good, despite all the CGI explosions.
