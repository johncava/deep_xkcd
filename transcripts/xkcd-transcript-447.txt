[Two Cueballs are standing in front of a whiteboard covered with equations.]
Cueball 1: I wish I could do math like when i was young.
Cueball 2: Huh?
Cueball 1: It doesn't come easy like it once did.
Cueball 2: Uh huh.
Cueball 1: Math is a game for the young. I need to sit back and let the future happen.
Cueball 2: You're thirteen.
Cueball 1: Yes, and it's time I accept that.
