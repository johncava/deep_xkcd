Notes from reading Redwall books for the first time since childhood.
Some of this feels familiar.
Aragorn: Hi, I'm Aragorn.
Martin: I'm Martin.
Aragorn and Martin: I'm here to reforge my broken sword so I can lead an army against the tyrant threatening my people. I live in a world of moral absolutes and racist undertones.
Martin: Jinx!
It startled me when characters mentioned Satan.
Redwall: "By Satan's whiskers..."
Redwall mentions God/Jesus 0 times.
Redwall mentions Satan/The Devil 4 times.
(Harry Potter protesters, take note.)
Even as a kid this bothered me: Why does everyone leave critical secret messages as simple riddles? It's silly to assume the intended recipient will be the only one to find and solve them. I would do things differently.
Matthias: The inscription is a message from Martin!
Brother Methuselah: What does it say?
Matthias: Hang on, it's encrypted with my public key.
