Cueball: So, how do you like your eggs in the morning?
Megan: Ooh, sunny side up.
Cueball: Oh. Huh.
Megan: Is that a problem?
Cueball: Well, it's just that I was trying to set you up for the "unfertilized" line.
Megan: Ah. Bad timing; I'm actually looking for casual sex. ...interested?
Cueball: I'd love to, but I've got like 20 more jokes to set up tonight. Hey, have you seen a priest and a rabbi?
