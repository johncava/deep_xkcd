Megan: This sucks. The median first marriage age is 26. The pools of singles is shrinking. I'm running out of time.
Cueball: Actually, not quite.
Cueball: Yes, older singles are rarer. But as you get older, the dateable age range gets wider. An 18-year-old's range is 16-22, whereas a 30-year-old's might be more like 22-46.
Text on chart: Standard creepiness rule: Don't date under (Age/2 + 7)
Cueball: I did some analysis of this with the Census Bureau numbers just last weekend. Your dating pool actually  until middle age. So don't fret so much!
[The first chart is labelled Singles, and is a decreasing graph. The second graph is labelled Dating Pool, and is a bell curve.]
Megan: Did your analysis say anything about the dating prospects of people who spend weekends at home making graphs?
Cueball: Come on. Somewhere at the edge of the bell curve is the girl for me.
