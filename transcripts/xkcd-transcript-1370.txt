[Ponytail and Science Girl are walking together.]
Ponytail: I can't imagine anyone who grew up on the Internet being able to run for President.
[Closeup of Science Girl.]
Science Girl: Why? Because it'd mark the handover of a world that no longer needs you to a generation you don't understand?
[Ponytail and Science Girl have stopped walking and are facing each other.]
Science Girl: ...Or because there would be embarrassing pictures of us as teenagers?
[Closeup of Ponytail.]
Ponytail: Um. The pictures one?
Science Girl (off-screen): Pictures of teens! How will we even survive??
