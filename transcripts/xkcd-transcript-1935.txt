[Megan is walking.]
Megan: I wonder if 2018 will be a leap year.
[Now it turns out that Cueball walks behind Megan.]
Cueball: ...it won't be, right?
Megan: I doubt anyone knows at this point.
[Same scene in a frame-less panel.]
Cueball: No, it's definitely not. Leap years are divisible by 4.
Megan: Right, and for odd numbers, that's easy. 
Megan: But 2018 is even.
Megan: 50/50 chance.
[Zoomed-out view with both walking in silhouette on a dark slightly curved ground.]
Cueball: I can settle this with a calculator.
Megan: No way. If it were easy to factor large numbers like that, modern cryptography would collapse.
Cueball: I see.
Megan: I just hope we manage to brute-force it by February.
