Final quote taken from the 1984 movie .
[Two people are in a room. One is standing up. There is litter around them.]
Cueball: Okay, that's all the Ghostbusters marathon I can handle. Later!
Friend: You can't leave! We just started the animated series!
Cueball: I've had my fill. I'm going home.
Friend: I can't let you do that.
[Cueball walks along a cord and past a box. The friend clicks a switch.]

[Cueball is bathed in some kind of aura emitted by the box.]
