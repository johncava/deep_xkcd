[Three kids are in a living room. Furniture and other things are knocked over, broken, or tilted. The first kid is holding a handle of a plunger with cables going offscreen.]
First Kid: I've dynamited a trench through the kitchen to divert flow!

[The second kid is aiming a hose at the floor.]
Second Kid: More hoses! We need to cool and solidify the surface layer!

[The third kid is standing on a chair, using a cell phone or radio.]
Third Kid: Where are the damn helicopters?
Like many kids, we sometimes pretended the floor was lava.
