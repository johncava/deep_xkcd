[Two Cueball-like soldiers with guns present Napoleon (recognizable by his Napoleon hat, aka a ) to an officer sitting behind his desk. The officer is pointing at Napoleon who has a small chain on his hands.]
Soldier at the front: This is Napoleon. He tried to take over the world.
Officer Cueball: Exile him to Elba!
[Three Cueball-like soldiers with guns present Napoleon again to the same officer sitting behind his desk. The officer has one hand held in front of him with his palm up. This time Napoleon has a larger chain on his hands and a ball and chain on his right leg. His head and hat is battered from the battle.]
Soldier at the front: It's us again. Napoleon escaped from Elba and tried to conquer the world. Again.
Officer Cueball: Send him someplace truly remote, like Saint Helena.
Soldier at the front: Yes, sir.

Several Years Later...
[Four Cueball-like soldiers with guns (one partly outside the frame) stand behind Napoleon and one more soldier stands in front of him as they again present him to the same officer. The officer is now standing behind his desk, holding it with one hand while the other is pointing up in the air. This time Napoleon has a octopus on his head, is dripping wet, still has the larger chain on his hands and the ball and chain on his right leg. Furthermore his legs are shackled. There are pools of water on the floor.]
Soldier at the front: Well, he swam back.
Officer Cueball: We must mount an expedition to the South Pole, where we will encase Napoleon in the Antarctic ice!"

A century later...
[President Kennedy is giving a speech standing on a podium behind a lectern, while Napoleon is standing behind him with the same restraining devices as before. Napoleon now has icicles dangling from his hat and a small piece of ice on his right leg around the knee.]
President Kennedy: We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy...
