[Cueball is telling a story to a Computer Scientist who is seated at his desk.]
Cueball: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere.
Computer Scientist: Uh huh.
Cueball: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place.
Computer Scientist: With you so far.
Cueball: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet.
Computer Scientist: Yeah?
CAPTION: I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story.
