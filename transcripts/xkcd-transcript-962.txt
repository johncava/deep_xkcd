[Cueball with an unusual suit runs right with a small cloud behind his legs. The frame of the panel is only two thirds the normal height and above the frame is the text from the narrator:]
Narrator: The Fermi Paradox: Planets are so common that life should be too. So where is it?
[Cueball keeps running with the small cloud behind his legs. Above him there are two frames with narration:]
Narrator: Well, now we know. 
Narrator: It's not that life inevitably destroys itself with war.
[Cueball leaps into the air off a jagged cliff edge with gray cliffs. The image frame only covers a small part of the center of this panel. Narration text is shown both above and below the image:]
Narrator: It's just that it takes longer to develop space colonization.
Narrator: Than it does to invent an activity
[A Youtube video is shown with the usual icons in the black bar below the image; play, volume, full screen etc. The video shows Cueball soaring downwards as indicated with four speed lines behind his spread out arms and legs. The strange suit has opened up revealing it to be a wingsuit. The sound is on and Cueball can be heard. Above the video frame there is a final narration text in a frame. Two people are watching the video together off-panel and their comments are shown below in two voice bubbles with arrows pointing left and right.]
Narrator: More fun than survival.
Cueball: Wheeeee!
Off-panel voice #1: Holy crap.
Off-panel voice #2: I don't care how dangerous it is. I have to try it.
