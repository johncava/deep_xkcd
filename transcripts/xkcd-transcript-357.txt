[Cueball is typing on a computer, and his friend is lying on the floor.]
"Noob" (on computer): *#!
Friend: Hey, ease up on the noobs. Like my mom always said, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
[Cueball has turned his chair around.]
Cueball: No, you don't.
Friend: You don't?
Cueball: Nope, set out a bowl of balsamic and a bowl of honey. The vinegar gets more.
[Cueball's friend is now sitting on the floor.]
Friend: ...Seriously?
Cueball: You have fruit flies. Try it yourself.
Later:
[Cueball's friend is standing in front of a table, talking into a phone. On the table, there are two bowls, and the bowl on the left seems to be surrounded by flies.]
Friend: Mother! You  to me! And it gets worse. I was watching a pot yesterday, and guess what it did? It  mother.
