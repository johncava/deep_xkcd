[Cueball in a car, sitting at a red light.]
Cueball: This light always takes forever. I'd like to smack the idiot who designed this intersection.
[An engineer steps up onto the hood of Cueball's car.]
Engineer: Hi.
Cueball: Who the hell are you?
Engineer: I designed this intersection.
Engineer [arms spread outward]: You're right - I should have just made the light shorter! Never mind the hours of simulation and testing I did. Never mind that this intersection interacts with it's neighbors in a complicated way and it took me a week to work out timing sequences that avoided total jams.
Engineer: Clearly, I'm a crappy engineer and you have a better solution. Go on, show me your proposed timings.
Cueball: Get the hell off my hood before I start driving and fling you into traffic.
Engineer: You can't. Light's red.
Cueball: Well, when will it change?
Engineer: Tuesday.
