[One man is sitting at a computer. Cueball sits at a separate desk. There is a clock that reads 2:53.]
Cueball: 253 is 11x23
Man at computer: What?
Cueball: I'm factoring the time.
Cueball: I have nothing to do, so I'm trying to calculate the prime factors of the time each minute before it changes.
Cueball: It was easy when I started at 1:00, but with each hour the number gets bigger
Cueball: I wonder how long I can keep up.
[Man at desk reaches back and touches the clock.]

[Clock now reads 14:53.]
Cueball: Hey!
Man at computer: Think fast.
