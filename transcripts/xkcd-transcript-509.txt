[Beret Guy, extension cord in hand, approaches Cueball as he works at his computer.]
Beret Guy: Can I plug my extension cord over here?
Cueball: No.
Beret Guy: Why?
Cueball: Solar Flares.
[A diagram is displayed, illustrating the Earth's magnetic field being permanently impacted by a large solar flare (represented by a large arrow).]
[A second diagram is presented, illustrating the Earth's rotation and the resulting impact that the solar flare would have on the earth's magnetic field.]
Cueball: A large solar flare could dent the Earth's magnetic field inwards. The Earth's spin could then induce a strong current in any long conductors, melting them and starting fires. By extending your cord, you could kill us all.
[Stunned, Beret Guy looks down at the cord he carries.]
Beret Guy: Really?
Cueball: Warn your friends.
[Dejected, the man walks away, cord in tow.]
[Cueball looks up from his computer as he is braced by Megan, a stern look in her face.]
Megan: That was mean.
Cueball: Listen,  has to keep Mythbusters in business. Next season should be fun.
