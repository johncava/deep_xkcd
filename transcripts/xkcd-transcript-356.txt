[Black Hat is sitting on a chair, Cueball is standing next to him. Across the street another Cueball-like guy is coming from a building walking towards the zebra crossing across from Black Hat.]
Black Hat: There's a certain type of brain that's easily disabled. 
Black Hat: If you show it an interesting problem, it involuntarily drops everything else to work on it.
[The Cueball-like man across the street is about to enter a crosswalk, which is seen from right behind Black Hat in his chair, holding on to the sign which is still pointing down. Cueball is looking on.]
Black Hat: This has led me to invent a new sport: Nerd Sniping. 
Black Hat: See that physicist crossing the road?
[Black Hat lifts up the sign when the physicist is in the middle of the street, halfway across the zebra crossing.]
Black Hat: Hey!
[A close up of Black Hat's sign is shown in a frame less panel. There is text above and below an image of a four by five grid of nodes with resistors (shown as wiggly lines) between every node and also continuing away from the 16 outer nodes. A total of 5 columns with 5 and 4 rows with 6 resistors for a total of 20 nodes and 49 resistors. Two nodes, a knight's move apart, are marked with red circles in the 3rd row 2nd column and the 2nd row 4th column.]
Sign: On this infinite grid of ideal one-ohm resistors, 
Sign: what's the equivalent resistance between the two marked nodes?
[The Cueball-like physicist has stopped pondering the questions a hand to his chin.]
