[Cueball stand with a keyboard next to a bed. The keyboard is connected with a wire to a computer on a desk to the right. He talks to Megan and a Cueball-like friend.]
Cueball: Hey, help me test the Trans-Consciousness Messaging Protocol.
Friend: What's that?
Cueball: I've been training myself to keep my fingers moving slightly as I fall asleep. So I can type from inside dreams.
[Cueball sits with the keyboard on the bed.]
Cueball: I'm going to sleep now. My computer will relay my messages to you as I explore the dream world.
[Cueball stand with the keyboard in a forest with tall trees. The leaves are not visible; they are above the top of the drawing. At the top, there is a frame with text:]
In the dream:
Cueball (thinking): So strange to think none of this is real. 
Cueball (thinking): And yet I have this lifeline to the internet back home.
[Cueball places the keyboard on a stone, bends down, and types.]
Cueball (thinking): A chance to speak from one reality to another. 
Cueball (thinking): I feel like Bell & Watson. I get to write the inaugural TCMP message. 
Cueball (thinking): Let's see...
Keyboard: *Type type type*
[Megan is at the computer, and the Cueball-like friend behind her looks at his message from the dream. At the top, there is a frame with text:]
Outside:
Megan: "F1RST P0ST!!"?
Friend: Great. He's jumped straight to trans-reality trolling.
