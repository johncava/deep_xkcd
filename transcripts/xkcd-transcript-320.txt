[There is a diagram that shows the hours in a week. It has sections labelled "bed" and below has sections labeled "night." They do not line up.]
[Two men are talking together.]
Cueball: You have trouble sleeping right?
Friend: Only when your mom is over.
[Cueball is now pointing to a chart.]
Cueball: Since your work is flexible-
Friend: -Like your mom-
Cueball: -you should try the 28-hour day - 20 awake, 8 asleep (or 19/9 if you prefer).
Friend: I prefer your mom.
Cueball: It synchs up with the week - you spend weekdays awake normally, then on weekends you can go out all night.
Friend: Just like your mom.
Cueball: It means four extra hours daily. You can stay up until you're exhausted every day and then spend a full 9 hours asleep each night!
Friend: But how much time can I spend doing your mom?
Cueball: You? I'm guessing three or four minutes, tops.
Friend: ...Well played.
