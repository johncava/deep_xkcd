[Cueball to the left talks to Megan, Ponytail and a Cueball-like guy, with a remote control. They are standing to the right. Behind Cueball, on the ground, there is a quadcopter.]
Cueball: Welcome to Quadcopter-flying school.
[Cueball looks over his shoulder as three other quadcopters fly in towards him from above and left. The other three people are in the same position.]

Cueball: Um
[Cueball is carried off by quadcopters, his head has already exited the top right corner, only his legs and the last quadcopter still in the frame. The other three have turned around looking up and right after him.]
[Megan looks down again and the other two turns towards Megan. Cueball is gone and has only left his "tame" quadcopter behind on the ground.]
Megan: Should we have helped?
Ponytail: No. It's cruel, but we have to let nature take its course.
