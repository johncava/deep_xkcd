[Beret Guy and Megan are walking through a wood.]
Megan: There are these orchids whose flowers look like female bees. When males try to mate with them, they transfer pollen.
[Megan kneels next to a flower.]
Megan: This orchid -  - makes flowers, but no bees land on them because the bee it mimics went extinct long ago.
[Megan stands.]
Megan: Without its partner, the orchid has resorted to self-pollinating, a last-ditch genetic strategy that only delays the inevitable. Nothing of the bee remains, but we know it existed from the shape of this flower.
[They walk on past the flower.]
Megan: It's an idea of what the female bee looked like to the male bee...
Megan: ...as interpreted by a plant.
Beret Guy: Wow, so...
[We see a full-colour painting of an orchid flower. It has purple-pink petals on a mottled grey background, along with the bee-like parts. It's quite a realistic painting.]
...the only memory of the bee is a painting by a dying flower.
[The flower is alone in a panel.]
[Beret Guy walks back on screen.]
[Beret Guy kneels down next to it.]
Beret Guy: I'll remember your bee, orchid. I'll remember you.
[Beret Guy walks off-panel again.]
