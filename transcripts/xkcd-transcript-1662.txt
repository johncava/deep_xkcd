Jack and Jill
went up the hill
To fetch a  of water.
Jack fell down
and broke his crown,
And Jill came tumbling after.
Jill and Jack
began to frack.
The oil boosts their town.
But fractures make
the bedrock shake
and Jack came tumbling down.
Jack and Jill went up a hill 
To fetch a pail of water. 
Alas, that hill was San Juan Hill, 
And gruesome was the slaughter. 
[Megan is watching as the two kids Jill (drawn as Science Girl) and Jack (with spiky hair) are walking by her. Jack has a pail in his hand.]
Jill: Me and Jack are going up the hill to fetch a pail of water.
[Megan, standing back alone, calls out after them.]
Megan: Okay, have fun!
[Beat panel.]
Megan: ...Wait. What the  is going on with the hydrology around here?
