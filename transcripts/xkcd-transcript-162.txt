[Cueball sits sideways on a bed under an open window in the corner of a room. He is looking at Megan, who is spinning fast, indicated with two large circles indicating where her arms that a spread far out rotate, as well as two smaller circles around her knees and feet. The bed sheets are clearly messed up, as if someone has used it for activities other than sleeping. It is night and dark gray outside the window, and inside the room everything is also gray but lighter. Behind the spoken text, the background is white, but fades to the darker gray at the edges. There is also different gray shading in different parts of the room.]
Cueball: What are you doing?
Megan: Spinning counterclockwise
Megan: Each turn robs the planet of angular momentum
Megan: Slowing its spin the tiniest bit
Megan: Lengthening the night, pushing back the dawn
Megan: Giving me a little more time here
Megan: With you
