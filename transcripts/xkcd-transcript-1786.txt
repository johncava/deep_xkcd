[Cueball looking at garbage chute attached to wardrobe. A Black Hat answers him from off panel.]
Cueball: What's this thing on your wardrobe?
Black Hat (off-panel): Garbage chute.
[In a frame-less panel Cueball has turned away from the wardrobe (now off-panel) and he walks towards Black Hat.]
Cueball: Into a wardrobe?  
Black hat: There's some sort of portal to a magical land in there. Half the furniture I get has them-it's kinda a pain.
[Cueball stops walking closer to Black Hat.]
Cueball: You dump your trash in ?  
Black Hat: Yeah, it's a real time-saver.  
Black Hat: There's a huge cat in there, but I have a spray bottle I use when he tries to come up through the chute.
