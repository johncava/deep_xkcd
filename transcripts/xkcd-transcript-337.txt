[Cueball is in a post office wearing earphones connected to his iPod. There are several other people, including an old version of White Hat at the counter with a cane and Hairbun with a long narrow box entering the office by the door. Behind the counter Ponytail stand together with a Cueball-like guy. Another person is obscured by the lowest of the three connected thought bubles emanating from Cueball to the left. A fourth thought buble is below Cueball to the right. Above all this is a caption:]
I spend a lot of time mentally choreographing elaborate fight scenes with strangers around me.
Cueball's thoughts: Okay - if that old man pulls a crossbow,
Cueball's thoughts: I'll throw the postal scale at him and dive backward behind the stamps machine.
Cueball's thoughts: But what if the lady by the door has a katana in that box?
Cueball's thoughts: Better set my iPod to the "Kill Bill" fight theme, just in case.
