[Ponytail sitting in front of a computer screen typing. Cueball speaks only off-panel, but since this is a direct continuation of comic 1513 and 1695: Code Quality and Code Quality 2 where Cueball is shown, there can be no doubt it is him.]
Ponytail: Your code looks like song lyrics written using only the stuff that comes after the question mark in a URL.
Cueball (off-panel): Sorry.
[Zoom in on Ponytail's upper body.]
Ponytail: It's like a JSON table of model numbers for flashlights with "tactical" in their names.
[Zoom back out again. Ponytail has lifted her hands off the table.]
Ponytail: Like you read Turing's 1936 paper on computing and a page of JavaScript example code and guessed at everything in between.
[Zoom in again on Ponytail's face.]
Ponytail: It's like a leet-speak translation of a manifesto by a survivalist cult leader who's for some reason obsessed with memory allocation.
Cueball (off-panel): I can get someone else to review my code.
Ponytail: Not more than once, I bet.
