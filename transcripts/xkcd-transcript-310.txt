I understand now. There's no choir of angels when you meet the right person. It's about growing out of your fears to realize what you have is what you want.
[Cueball and the woman are getting married. They stand under a gate of honor with a priest in front of them.]
Girl: I do.
Cueball: I do.
[Cueball walks hand in hand with blond girl when a cloud with trumpeting angels appears over Megan.]
Megan: Hi.
[Same picture but without the cloud and angels. Cueball's thought is written in a frame with yellow background.]
Well, shit.
