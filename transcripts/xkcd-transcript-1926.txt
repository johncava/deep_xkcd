[Cueball is at his desk in a swivel chair, using his computer. Ponytail walks towards him.]
Ponytail: That's the ugliest mess of code I've ever seen! What on earth are you working on?
[Cueball swivels his chair to face Ponytail in a frameless panel.]
Cueball: It's nothing weird this time, I swear.
Cueball: It just looks bad because it's a spreadsheet formula.
[Cueball is facing his computer again.]
Cueball: ...which assembles a Haskell function.
Ponytail: Uhhh.
Cueball: ...for parsing HTML.
Ponytail: ...oh my God.
[Ponytail is pointing away from the scene.]
Cueball: It's ok! Nothing depends on this.
Ponytail: That wall isn't load-bearing. Does that mean we can just throw hammers at it?
Cueball: ...I mean...
Ponytail: Wait. Crap.
