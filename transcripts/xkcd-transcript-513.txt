[Cueball is talking to a girl.]
Cueball: I have a crush on you.
[Cueball is shown alone.]
Cueball: I could ask you out, and move on with my life if you said no.
Cueball: Or, WE COULD BE FRIENDS!
Cueball: See, I don't want to consider that you might not be attracted to me. I'm scared of rejection, so I've decided relationships should grow smoothly out of friendships.
[Megan is shown sitting at her computer.]
Cueball: When you have problems, I'll be there for you, night after night.
Cueball: Selflessly.
Computer (Instant message from boy): *hug*
[Megan is shown slamming door and walking to Cueball to get a hug.]
Cueball: I'll tear down the jerks you date, and wait for you to realize how good I am for you. That only  will ever understand you.

Megan: 
Cueball: There there
[Cueball is shown alone again.]
Cueball: You don't want to hurt my feelings, and I won't ever force the issue. I'll tell myself it's because I "Value our friendship."
Cueball: Bit by bit, I'll make you depend on me.
[Cueball and girl are shown sitting on a rock in a park, reading a book together.]
Cueball: You'll think about how long it would take to build this kind of connection again.
[Cueball and girl are shown sitting on a couch drinking, getting closer, and kissing.]
Cueball: And in a moment of weakness
Cueball: and loneliness
Cueball: you'll give in.
[Megan is shown sitting at the computer with Cueball behind her facing the other way washing dishes.]
Cueball: It'll feel comfortable and natural. You'll quietly revise your definition of love and try to be happy. And sometimes you will be.
[Megan is shown sitting at the computer.]
Cueball: Only the wistfulness in your gaze and the tiny pause before you say "I love you" will hint that this wasn't the ending you'd hoped for.
Cueball: Sound good?
[Megan is holding hands with another boy, talking to Cueball.]
Megan: ...I'm going to date this jerk.
Cueball: But he doesn't respect you!
