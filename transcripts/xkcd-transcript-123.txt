James Bond is moving in a circle, and is therefore accelerating. The force keeping him there is an inward force of contact against the centrifuge, a centripetal force. Via Newton's , since the centrifuge is pushing Bond inward, Bond is pushing the centrifuge outward. The centrifuge's material is strong enough not to break under this force, however.
In James Bond's frame of reference, Bond is at rest. He is kept there by two forces: the above-mentioned inward force of contact against the centrifuge, and an . He feels both forces.
[James Bond is strapped to a giant wheel suspended from the ceiling. Black Hat is standing next to two levers.]
Black hat: How do you like my centrifuge, mister Bond? When I throw this lever, you will feel centrifugal force crush every bone in your body.
[Same scene, but a closer shot.]
Bond: You mean centripetal force. There's no such thing as centrifugal force.
Black hat: A laughable claim, mister Bond, perpetuated by overzealous teachers of science. Simply construct Newton's laws in a rotating system and you will see a centrifugal force term appear as plain as day.
[Closer shot, only Bond's head is visible.]
Bond: Come now, do you really expect me to do coordinate substitution in my head while strapped to a centrifuge?
Black hat: No, Mister Bond. I expect you to die.
