[Luigi with green clothes in a green go-cart is clearly in the lead of a game of Mario Kart with Mario in red clothes in a red go-cart is so far behind that he seems much smaller. Two speech bubbles with arrows pointing at the two shows what Megan and Cueball, shown later, says to each other]
Megan (playing Mario): Sometimes I stop right before the finish line.
Cueball (playing Luigi): Why?
[A small square panel is inserted at the bottom of the first, crossing over the frame to the next panel and below the bottom of these panel. It shows Megan sitting on the floor leaning up against a coach while holding the game control in both hand looking at the large TV in front of her only  partly inside the frame. Her speech bubble is like the previous panel, pointing at her with an arrow, but most of the bubble is inside the first panel and also breaking into the next panel.]
Megan: 'Cause I know I've won.
[Scene moved to look in from the direction of the TV at the coach. Cueball is sitting on the other end of the coach to the left holding his hands out to either side while looking down at Megan on the floor, who is still holding her remote in both hands playing the video game.]
Megan: It proves I'm playing for fun, on my own terms. That I don't need validation from the machine.
Megan: That I'm not a rat pulling a lever.
[Scene moved to the side, showing both the coach with Cueball in it holding his hands up, Megan in front on the floor working the remote and the entire TV. Speech from the TV is shown in a broken bubble.]
Cueball: ...Man. Good Call. Let's stop and explore the course for a-
Game: 
Cueball: Hey!
Megan: Ha ha!
[Zoom in on the coach still from the side, Cueball leaning forward with the game control in his hand on the arm rest and Megan on the floor sitting more relaxed with the remote in one hand.]
Cueball: Dammit, I'm a sucker for your "Be a Rebel" speech.
Megan: It's more fun than a blue shell.
