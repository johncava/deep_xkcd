Wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back.
Megan: Dear Ke$ha,
Megan: It's hard to describe the pain of a deeply infected dental nerve.
[Megan putting her hands in a bowl.]
Megan: To get an idea, put your hands in a bowl full of ice cubes. Hold them there for 90 seconds.
Megan: Now imagine that pain in your jaw, every minute of every hour, bright and searing, washing out everything. You can't party all night. You can barely stand up. There's only the pain.
Megan: So, some friendly advice: When you wake up in the morning, before you brush your teeth with a bottle of Jack,
Megan: Brush them with actual toothpaste.
