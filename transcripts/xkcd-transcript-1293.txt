[Beret Guy walks in, followed by a...'prospective hire'.]
Beret Guy: Welcome to our company! We're headquartered here, in this real building I found!
[Both people sit down at a table. The 'hire' has a tray with food and a beverage. Beret Guy has a bowl. In the adjacent wall, there is a power outlet with a paper label taped to it marked "Soup". A small roll of wire sits next to Beret Guy's chair.]
'Hire': What do you.. ?
Beret Guy: We make stuff for phones! Like apps and stickers.
[Beret Guy grabs the roll of wire.]
Beret Guy: We want to hire you to write on our computers. We can offer you a bunch of paychecks! 
[Beret Guy unrolls the wire and plugs it into the wall.]
'Hire': ...Are you sure this is a company?
Beret Guy: I hope so!
[Soup (or something one can only hope is soup) streams out of the plugged-in wire into Beret Guy's bowl.]
