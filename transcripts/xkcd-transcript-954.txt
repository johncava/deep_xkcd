[Black Hat is in the middle of on an escalator with five other people as it ascends. He carries something like a a pole.]
[Zoom in on Black Hat and Cueball.]
Cueball: This is a long escalator.
Black Hat: 70 meters. Longest in the country.
[Black Hat goes upwards holding his pole.]
[Cueball is still behind Black Hat.]
Cueball: Why're you carrying a chin-up bar?
Black Hat: Why aren't you wearing a hat?
[The view returns to the original view only showing the six people ascending, only shifted so they are all a bit longer to the right.]
Cueball: I'm not really a hat person.
Black Hat: And I'm not really a not-carrying-a-chin-up-bar person.
[Close up on Cueball on the escalator.]
[Zoom out. Black Hat still has the pole in his hands.]
Cueball: Seriously, why did you bring it?
Black Hat: How should I know? I'm not a psychologist.
[Zoom in on the top of the escalator where Black Hat steps off and installs the chin-up bar on the exit of the escalator.]
  
[View from above towards both ascending and descending escalators. Black Hat and Cueball are on the descending escalator.]
[The final panel takes up two entire rows and shows all people falling down.]
