[White Hat and Cueball standing together.]
White Hat: Many people are mildly dehydrated. And don't realize it. You should drink at least six glasses of water per day.
[A voice comes from off-panel to the left as Ponytail enters from the left and Black Hat from the right in this frameless panel.]
Off-panel voice: No,  glasses!
Ponytail: I heard ten.
Black Hat: You need to drink at least five glasses of water per minute.
[Megan is standing to the left holding a book or a thick binder along her side while holding up a finger with the other hand. A question comes from off-panel to the right. Above her a caption is written in a small frame that breaks the top of this panel's frame:]
Later:
Megan: Okay, I just read through every study I could find to try to figure out whether low-grade dehydration is even a real thing.
Off-panel voice: What did you learn?
[Megan looking downwards, has two starbursts a circles and two dots above her head signifying dizziness. Cueball stands to the right as another voice comes from off-panel to the right.]
Megan: If you spend all day doing research and forget to eat or drink, you start to feel pretty bad.
Off-panel voice: I'll get some water.
Megan:  - Whoa, feeling dizzy.
Cueball: Maybe you should just drink straight from the tap.
