[Cueball and a friend stand in front of Cueball's bookcase. His friend flips through a number of them.]
Friend: All your books are full of blank pages.
Cueball: Not true. That one has some ink on page 78.
Friend: A smudge.
Cueball: So?
Friend: There are no words. You're not reading. There's no  there.
Cueball: Maybe not for you. When I look at those books, I think about all  of stories.
Cueball: Reading is about more than what's on the page. Holding a book prompts my mind to enrich itself. Frankly, I suspect the book isn't even necessary.
Cueball: The whole industry is evil. Greedy publishers and rich authors try to convince us our brains  their words. But I refuse to be a sucker.
Friend: Who sold you all these blank books?
