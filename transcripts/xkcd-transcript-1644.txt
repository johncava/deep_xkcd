[A thin panel where a male TV-host (with hair like Megan, but male according to official transcript), holding his hands up, is drawn in white on a black background. Behind him is an audience drawn in faint gray lines consisting of Hairy (to the left) and two Cueball-like guys and Ponytail (seen in a rare full face position) to the right of the host. One of the Cueball-like guys is partly hidden behind the host.]
Host: Welcome to stargazing, with your host, me.
Host: I'm a doctor or whatever.
[Same scene as before but in a broader panel, and the host is now holding only one hand up with a finger pointing up. The audience is the same four people, but now Hairy has moved further to the left in the panel to make room for Megan also to the left of the host.]
Host: I'm not gonna waste your time on the shitty stars.
Host: Just the good stuff.
Host: Honestly half of 'em just look like dots.
[A frame-less drawing with a zoom out showing the group of six people in black silhouette on a white background. Part of the ground beneath them is shown as a black pool. The host is pointing up with one hand. The people have been rearranged, so left of the host is now a Cueball-like guy and Megan, and to the right is the other Cueball-like guy, then Ponytail (seen from the side as usual) and  Hairy. All are looking up following the host's directions.]
Host: This is Sirius. It's the brightest star in our sky so it's in charge.
Host: It's really two stars but one of them is barely even trying.
Host: This is Andromeda, it's too big to think about, so let's not.
[Zoom in of the host's upper body, again drawn in white on a black background. He is looking right gesturing with one arm raised, and the other still pointing up with a finger stretched out. His audience is no longer shown.]
Host: That red stars is Betelgeuse. It's gonna explode someday.
Host: Can't happen soon enough, as far as I'm concerned. I-
Host: 
Host: Space is 
[Same scene as the previous panel, but the host has turned towards left looking at someone in the audience (not shown) who speaks off-screen. He has taken both his hands down for the first time.]
Off-screen voice: Are you  you're an astronomer?
Host: People keep asking that, so I finally tried to look that word up in a dictionary, and  is that book ever boring. No thank you.
Off-screen voice: But-
Host:
