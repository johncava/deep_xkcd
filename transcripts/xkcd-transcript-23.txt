[A collection of phrases on T-shirts. The first and the last on actual black T-shirts worn by the same person, whose facial expression is more sad on the last one.]
I see dumb people
As a matter of fact the world  revolve around me
I can only please one person per day / today is not your day.
You know what your problem is? You're stupid.
Get a clue
Do I  like a people person?
Your village called / they want their idiot back
Go away
I hate you all
Die.
Help.
Maybe if this T-shirt is witty enough, someone will finally love me.
Oh God I'm so alone.
