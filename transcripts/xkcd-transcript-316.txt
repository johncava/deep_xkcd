My neighbor has loud sex.
[Cueball in bed, covering his head with a pillow. There is sound coming from outside.]



Good for her and all, but it keeps me up at night.
And she's so smug about it.
[Cueball and neighbor coming out of their apartments.]
Neighbor: Sorry, could you hear us last night? Oh, you know how it gets sometimes.
Cueball: Not really...
But tonight I finally get my revenge. Because now I have a loud girlfriend too.
[Megan with "LOUD" and an arrow pointing to her.]
And an elliptical reflector dish.

[Cueball and Megan having sex, with the dish behind them reflecting the sex sound effects, in a way that they focus, through walls, on his neighbor sitting up in bed while holding her head in pain.]
