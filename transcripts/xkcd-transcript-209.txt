[Beret Guy, in a kayak holding a paddle, is talking to Cueball, standing on a pier.]
Beret Guy: Come explore the future with me!
Cueball: Huh? What's that you're in?
[Close up on Beret Guy and his kayak. The tip of the pier can be seen.]
Beret Guy: A two seat kayak!
Cueball: I see, but why do you have it?
[Close up on Cueball. The tip of the kayak and the tip of the paddle can be seen. Beret Guy and the waterline cannot be seen.]
Beret Guy: We'll find out! The future is a big place!
Cueball: So the kayak travels through time?
[Slightly zoomed-out version of the third panel. The tip of the paddle has disappeared but the waterline is visible again.]
Beret Guy: Sure! Just like everything else! It also goes over water. Come on!
