[Hairy is speaking into a microphone while interviewing Megan.]
Hairy: Tell us, are you scientists excited for the eclipse?
Megan: Sure, lots of people are!
[Zoom in on Megans head.]
Hairy (off-panel): Is this a big moment for science?
Megan: It's a big moment for the sky.
[Same setting as first panel in a wider panel.]
Hairy: Are people really excited enough about science to travel to see it?
Megan: Honestly, it's not that scientific. I mean, it's cool if you're into astronomy, but it's also cool if you're, like, aware of the sun.
[Same setting.]
Hairy: But there's lots of science involved.
Megan: I guess? There's lots of science involved in the Olympics, but you don't need to be a scientist to watch.
[Megan holds a hand out towards Hairy.]
Megan: It's not like the concept is all that arcane or mathematical. It's a thing going in front of another thing.
[Zoom in on Megan holding both arms out.]
Hairy (off-panel): Then why are you so excited?
Megan: I'm excited because it's a nearly once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch the sun go dark, hear birds freak out, and see a glowing ring appear in the sky with a sunset on every horizon.
[Back to same setting as in the first panel.]
