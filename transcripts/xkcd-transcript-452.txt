[Beret Guy and Cueball are rappelling down separate ropes into the interior workings of a large machine.]
Cueball: Okay, we're in the belly of the machine. You got the charges?
Beret Guy: The what?
[The two are standing next to some large pieces of machinery.]
Cueball [gesturing]: The explosive charges!
Beret Guy [pulling out a bag]: I just brought this bag for pastries.
Cueball: The hell? We're on a mission here!
Beret Guy [looking around]: This isn't a bakery?
Cueball [head in hand]: Oh, Christ, not this shit again.
Beret Guy [crouching by some lug nuts lying on a piece of machinery]: What about these scones?
Cueball: Those are lug nuts.
Beret Guy [stuffing them in his mouth]: ...Maybe SOME of them aren't.  Ow!
