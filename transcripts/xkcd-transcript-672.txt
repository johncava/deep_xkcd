Facebook: Susie
Reconnect with her
[Phone icon] Send her a text
Cueball: Come on, Facebook. I know I shouldn't.
Facebook: Susie
She'd come over
[Bed icon] You don't have to fall asleep alone.
Cueball: It's been so hard to stop. But she's falling for me, and I can't keep getting her hopes up like this.
Facebook: Susie
Life is complicated
[Icon of stick figures embracing] She's so warm against you. You both want it.
Cueball: (pulling out phone) Maybe if I just make it clear it's not going to be a thing...
Cueball: Yeah, we'll just have a talk.
Facebook: Susie
Oh yeah. Mmm...
[Webcam icon] Leave your webcam on so I can watch.
Cueball: Okay, this feature is getting creepier and creepier.
