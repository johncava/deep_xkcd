[Cueball and Megan walking outdoors]
Cueball: Can't wait for this stupid year to be over.
[The two approach a fallen tree]
Megan: I can. This year made the future scarier. So much of why 2016 was bad was because of the things it sent us into 2017 without.
[Megan has hopped up onto the tree trunk and begins to walk along it]
Cueball: You gotta have hope, though.
Megan: You say that, but you also said all this awful stuff couldn't happen, and it did. You're as clueless as the rest of us.
[Cueball also walks along the tree trunk as Megan stops and turns to look at him]
Cueball: Well, if we're wrong about which bad things can happen, it's got to make us at least a  less sure about which good things can't.

Megan: I guess.

Cueball: Plus, 2017 has a cool eclipse in it.
Megan: Ooh, yeah!
Cueball: And it's prime. Prime years have always been good for me.
Megan: Sure, I'll take it.
