Voice: Where are you going?
Cueball: Convention.
Voice: What for?
Cueball: Well, you know furries, right?
Voice: Sure...
[Cueball closes suitcase.]
Cueball: We're furries whose animal identities have a thing for pretending to be humans.
Voice: I see.

Cueball, with glasses and a mug: How's the weather?
Megan: Great! I've been driving my car and having a job all day!
Cueball: Did you meow?
Megan: Not once!
