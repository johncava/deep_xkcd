Ponytail: You watched the tape!?
Cueball: Yeah, sorry.
Ponytail: Now you'll die in seven days!
Cueball: It's worse than that.
[TV is cut from the frame.]
Ponytail: ...You didn't.
Cueball: Yup.
[Both are now in front of a computer, Ponytail leaning in.]
Ponytail: Great, It's got 363,104 views .
Cueball: They kept Rickrolling me! It was only fair.
