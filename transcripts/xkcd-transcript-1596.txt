[A rocket is about to launch. A small object is near the top of the rocket.]
Countdown: 
Offscreen Voice 1: Tank and booster are go for launch.
Offscreen Voice 2: Safety console?
Offscreen Voice 3: Check. Safety-
Offscreen Voice 4: Wait.
[The small object moves to further to the right.]
Offscreen Voice 1: What is it?
Offscreen Voice 2: On the live feed- a cool bird just flew past the tower!
[The launch scene now a background silhouette, the small object of everyone's attention is no longer on-panel.]
Offscreen Voice 1: Whoa, what kind?
Offscreen Voice 2: Like a hawk, maybe!
Offscreen Voice 1: Could it be a vulture?
Offscreen Voice 2: I doubt it. The wings were flat, not in a "V".
Offscreen Voice 3: It could be an eagle!
Offscreen Voice 2: Ooh!
[The scene is returns to full contrast, with at least a token attention being paid to it, once more.]
Offscreen Voice 1: This is launch control. We have a possible sighting of a cool bird. Halt the countdown.
Offscreen Voice 2: Someone get some binoculars up here!
Offscreen Voice 3: I want to see!
