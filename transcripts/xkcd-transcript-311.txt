[Cueball and Megan are talking together as they walk away from a cinema.]
Cueball: Another summer gone without a mindless big-budget action movie.
Megan: Huh? Die Hard was nothing BUT action!
Cueball: No, it was too talky.
Megan: What? Too talky?
Cueball: I tallied it minute-by-minute. It's at least 60% people walking and talking. ALL those movies are.
Cueball: Just once, I want a real action movie. 30 seconds of exposition followed by a perfect 90-minute action scene. One with a huge budget, a good choreographer, and a great director.
Megan: And they should center it around some character we already know, someone we never get tired of watching.
Cueball: I think we've got something here...
[A movie poster is shown.]
 Coming this summer
 River Tam
 Beats up EVERYONE
[The poster shows a line of doorways. In the background, numerous people are lying on the ground or draped over doorways and windows. River Tam is doing a flying kick into someone's face, and another person is emerging from the doorway closest to the viewer.]
