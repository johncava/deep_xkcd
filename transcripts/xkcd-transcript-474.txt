[Cueball walks up to Megan sitting at bar.]
Cueball: So, the LHC's turning on. This could be our last night on earth.
[While Beret Guy as a bartender walks into the frame Megan replies without turning]
Megan: Gimme a break. They're not even colliding yet, and it won't do anything cosmic rays haven't.
[Cueball turns and walks away. But then Megan turns towards him and says:]
Megan: Hey, I didn't say no.
Megan: I'm a physics grad student. I need the excuse to party.
[Cueball turns back and they talk:]
Cueball: So, you're up for a night with a charming stranger?
Megan: Depends. Top or bottom?
Cueball: Hey, I haven't even bought you a drink.
Megan: Barkeep, two whiskey sours, straight down.
