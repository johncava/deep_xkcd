[Megan as a teacher speaks to a crowded classroom, where all students are grayed out except one of the Cueball students who is drawn in the normal black line. He has a big thought bubble over his head]
Megan: Your projects are due today by 5:00 PM.
Cueball (thinking): ...I didn't even know we had one.
[Zoom in in Cueball at his small desk still thinking. No other students are visible, but the desk next to his is shown although also fading out.]
Cueball (thinking): Wait. I don't think I've been attending. I must have forgotten I had this class. Shitshitshit.
[Cueball is sitting at his desk, but now seen from the side, looking from the edge of his desk. The very right part of the drawing, with Cueball's back and chair, now begins to fade.]
Cueball (thinking): Okay, I'm gonna fail. Will it hold me back? I just want to get out of here. I thought I had  my requirements already.
[Cueball takes his hand to his face. This panel fades so much it is only about half a panel. Even the frame around the panel disappears.]
