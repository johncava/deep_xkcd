[Black Hat and Danish are sitting in a train across from each other. Black Hat is writing in a journal.]
Black Hat: 
Danish: I see what you did there.
[Danish stands up.]
Danish: You were trying to open me up so you could hurt my feelings.
Danish: You like to hurt people.
[Danish walks closer.]
Danish: Well, I like to hurt people too. And you know what?
[Danish is in Black Hat's face.]
Danish: *whispering* 
Danish: I'm about to hurt you more than you could ever hurt me.
Danish: See, I just saw right through you.
Danish: Alone of all the people you'll ever meet, I understand you-
[Danish hits Black Hat's hat so it falls off.]
[Black Hat is surprised.]
[Danish catches Black Hat's hat and puts it on.]
Danish: -and you'll never see me again.
[Danish exits frame left.]
[Black Hat sits alone on the train.]
