[Three smaller panels with the same total height as the first two frames follows. In the first frame Cueball walks on a grey surface.]
[In the next Cueball is standing between two doors, looking over his shoulder towards the one to the left, but choosing the one to the right behind which a stair is. He is waking towards this door with his hand out towards the knob.]
[In the last of these smaller panels Cueball has just walked down to the bottom of the stairs.]
[Cueball walks towards a machine that is standing near a wall connected to a socket in the wall. On the machine it says:]
High pitched hum generator
[Cueball kneels behind the machine and unplugs it from the socket in the wall.]
