Bag Packer: Here you go!
[5 items placed in a single bag; heaviest item placed at the bottom.]
Shopper: Thanks!
Bag Packer: Here you go!
[Same items; heaviest item now placed in separate bag.]
Shopper: Oh, that's easier to carry.
Bag Packer: Here you go!
[Heavy item is now double bagged.]
Shopper: Double-bagging the big stuff makes sense...
Bag Packer: Here you go!
[The other 4 items are now split into 2 separate bags.]
Shopper: That's a bit wasteful...
Bag Packer: Here you go!
[The 2 separate bags are now double bagged.]
Shopper: You just put five items in six bags.
Bag Packer: Here you go!
[Every item is now in its own, double-bagged bag.]
Shopper: OK! I give up! I'll buy a reusable bag!
Bag Packer: Here you go!
[Reusable bag is double-bagged.]
Shopper: Augh!
