[A bald bearded man with glasses standing in his open doorway outside his house and a police man wearing a black peaked cap with white emblem standing on the stoop at the top of the stairs leading down from the house are swearing at each other]
Both: *#!
[The bearded man is in prison sitting on a bench behind bars.]
[Cueball, as the president of the United States, is standing behind a lectern with the Presidential Seal (eagle and all) on its front.]
President: To defuse this misunderstanding, I've invited both men to have a beer with me at the White House.
[A policeman is standing left and looking left while the bearded man is walking towards the president both with their hands stretched out towards each other. They are in the oval room in the White House with a couch and an oval carpet and two large windows.]
[The president has opened cabinet on top of another cabinet. He is looking into it with a hand on his chin.]
President: Actually, it seems we're out of beer.
Voice (off-panel): Is there anything else?
[Zoom in on the back of the president's head viewing the shelve in the cabinet with a single labeled bottle:]
Tequila
[The black Presidential Limo, with grayed out windows in the rear is being driven at high speed by the president who can be seen through the regular windows in the front of the car. The bearded man has his arms up and the policeman is waving his hat and holding the bottle of tequila are standing up looking out of the sunroof.]
All: 
[The policeman, the bearded man, and the president are sitting on a bench behind bars in the same prison from panel two.]
