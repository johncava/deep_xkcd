[Two guys, both Cueball-like, are standing at some kind of cliff edge.]
Friend: What time is it?
[The second guy (Cueball) looks at his watch in silence.]
[Then he answers the question]
Cueball: Now.
[Full scene is revealed: The two men (barely visible) are standing at the lip of a huge canyon in a rocky, barren landscape. A pock-marked moon and a ringed planet are visible in the burgundy-colored sky.]
[The two guys are again seen standing at what is now know to be the lip of the canyon.]
Friend: That's a pretty boring answer.
[Next panel is the same as before.]
Cueball: Is not.
[Last panel is the same as before.]
Cueball: It's the least boring answer imaginable.
