[Beret Guy and Megan stand next to a large pole with a note on it. Beret Guy points at the pole.]
Beret Guy: Check it out! I threw my magic beans on the ground here yesterday, and this big tree appeared!
[Zoom out, the pole is revealed to have branches. Around the pole are trees about 1/9th of the height of the pole.]
Megan: That's a cell tower.
Beret Guy: No way - it has branches!
Beret Guy: See?
Beret Guy: I'm gonna climb it!
[Same as frame as the first. Beret Guy starts climbing the pole.]
Megan: No, they just put those there to make it look-
Megan: ...Never mind.
[There is a caption in a small frame inlaid at the top of the last frame:]
Later...
[Megan looks at her phone while Beret Guy walks towards her holding an axe.]
Megan: Why do I have no signal?
Beret Guy: There were scary giants with yellow helmets in that tree! Luckily I cut it down before they ate me.
