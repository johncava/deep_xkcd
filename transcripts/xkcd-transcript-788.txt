[Death with his scythe is driving a horse-drawn carriage. The text is written in two frames above and below the carriage:]
Because I could not stop for death
He kindly stopped for me
[Hairbun grabs Death by the arm and pulls him off the carriage. There is a circle with the letter Y in the lower left corner. The text above the carriage is in a frame.]
The carriage held but just oursel-
Death: Hey!
Hands holding Death: 
Circle: Y
[Hairbun takes off in the carriage with the scythe, leaving Death behind on the ground in the dust from the carriage taking off.]
Hairbun: Hyah!
[Hairbun stands with her arms crossed, and Death's scythe next to her. The first text above her is printed as the official logo and the text below is in a type of square brackets.]
