Megan: I know you're not that into my sister, but she's really crushing on you.
Cueball: Yeah, it's awkward.
Megan: She's in a rough spot. It's a lot to ask, but could you take her out and... Dissuade her, without rejecting her?
Cueball: Wait a second. Are you asking me to show her a mediocre time?
