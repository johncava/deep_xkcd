Cueball: I had a dream that I met a girl in a dying world.
[In the next frame, Cueball's words fill the entire frame.]
Cueball: It was all coming apart. Hairline cracks in reality widened to yawning chasms. Everything was going dark and light all at once, and there was a sound like breaking waves rising into a piercing scream at the edge of hearing. I knew we didn't have long together.
Cueball: She grabbed me and spoke a stream of numbers into my ear. Then it all went away.
[A girl grabs him as cracks in the edges of the panel become tendrils and grab Cueball and the girl.]
Cueball: I woke up. The memory of the apocalypse faded to mere fancy, but the numbers burned bright in my mind. I wrote them down right away.
[A note reads: 42.39561  -71.13051  2007 09 23  14 38 00.]
Cueball: They were coordinates. A place and a time, neither one too far away.
Cueball: What else could I do? When the day came, I went to the spot and waited.
Friend: ...and?
Cueball: It turns out wanting something doesn't make it real.
