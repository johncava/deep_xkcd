 published his , which changed views on space, time, mass, and energy, and laid the groundwork for much of modern physics. They included his papers on  and on  ("E = mc"). He had an infant son in 1905 (born May 1904).
The use of the term "dad" helps readers tune in emotionally. "Proving scientists wrong about everything" is obviously an inflation of Einstein's achievements. Einstein was awarded the  in 1921 for his work on the ; his work on relativity was still not accepted by many physicists at that time.
. "should have died" seems to be referring to six passengers whose survival was downright miraculous, though the wording is (deliberately) ambiguous to imply the six passengers  to have died. Possibly referred to here is the survival of , chairman and managing director of the White Star Line (the company responsible for the Titanic), who was condemned as a coward for leaving the sinking liner.
The  was passed, guaranteeing voting rights for women in all US states. The prediction of new prohibitions is a reference to alcohol prohibition under the authority granted to the federal government by the . While the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified before women's suffrage was guaranteed by the Nineteeth, alcohol prohibition was widely seen as an issue driven by women's opinions (hence the suggestion that more things would be prohibited now that women had the vote).
 was discovered.
This is a reference to the , the most devastating stock market crash in history and the beginning of the Great Depression. The "embarassing reactions" may be a reference to the suicides of people suddenly impoverished by the depression.
[GIFS] indicates that the post will contain animated GIF images, which are a crude form of short video. Presumably, these GIFs will feature the aforementioned suicides, which would be considered tasteless at best. The  which supports animation was released in 1990, so animated GIFs (or computers for that matter) didn't exist in 1929. 
1945 is the year that World War II ended. It's also the year that many war crimes committed by Nazi Germany were discovered or declassified. These events would be cause enough for anyone to re-evaluate their belief in the inherent goodness of the human race. However, the specific phrase "lose faith in humanity" is one often employed on the web by rather over-dramatic people in response to something someone did to exasperate them; and because that particular wording is closely associated with exaggerative tendencies, its usage in relation to Nazi war crimes only downplays their seriousness.
1948 is when the Soviet Union established the , preventing food and other critical supplies from reaching occupied Berlin. In response, Western forces organized the .
The  was developed.
"One weird trick" is a common phrase used in Internet ads: see  for more information. It may also refer to the fact that polio viruses were used as the first vaccines.
The Soviet Union launched , the world's first artificial satellite. A  is when a woman unintentionally exposes all or part of one or both of her nipples; in the context of the internet, it generally refers to a photograph capturing such a moment.
It would of course have to be some really big nips to be visible from space... So click ahead then!
 and  ( younger brother) were both assassinated in 1968 (five year after JFK).
Assassinations are rare and considered to be always tragic, so "ranking" them trivializes the political and emotional depth of the events.
 performed the first manned lunar landing. During this historic trip newspapers printed as many pictures of astronauts as they could.
Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into its flight. See  for details. This was the first shuttle mission that included a teacher on board as part of the crew (, ), so there were many children -- a New York Times poll put the number at 48% of 9-13 year olds in the US -- watching this particular launch live as teachers around the country had TV sets in their classrooms showing the ill-fated launch in real time. The launch was not shown on most mainstream TV stations; only  broadcast it live.
Since this many children did see it, there would also have been several terminal ill children watching, and likely also some press out at one such place. So they could get this picture. And again toy with our emotions.

A 90s kid is someone born in the late 80s or early 90s (and spent most their childhood in the 1990s). Headlines like  toy with their readers' sense of nostalgia. The parody headline is funny because it starts precisely on the first day of the 1990s, meaning that the only "90s kids" that it would apply to would be newborns. This is a reference to a common joke about the 90s not having a concrete identity in some ways like the 70s or 80s did in terms of popular culture, and yet those born in that decade always seem to have long lists of things that make you a "90s kid".
Einstein published his theory of , which is a vast generalization of the theory of  from 1905 and provides a model for gravity. In 1916 Einstein had two sons who lived in Zurich while he lived in Berlin.
