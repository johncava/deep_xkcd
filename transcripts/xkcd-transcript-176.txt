Cueball: Every morning for a week now I've gone out driving before sunrise.
I wanted to get lost in the dark, park my car, listen to music, and sip from a warm drink as dawn broke around me, gradually revealing a landscape I'd never before seen. A chain of unique beginnings forcing wonder into the seeds of each day.
Cueball: But I guess I need more willpower, because each sunrise just found me at your mom's apartment again.
