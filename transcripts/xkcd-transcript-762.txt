[Megan stands by a TV set and addresses Cueball in the couch and his Cueball-like friend who sits in front of the TV on the floor.]
Megan: While I'm up, does anyone want a sandwich?
Cueball: Is "sandwich" a metaphor?
[A frame-less panel with the same scene, without the TV. Cueball has taken a hand to his chin and the friend on the floor looks down.]
Megan: No, I'm bad at metaphors. But I could try a simile.
Cueball: I guess that's  a metaphor. 
Cueball: Sure.
[While Megan walks past them, Cueball leans forward and his friends looks back up at him as they continue to speak.]
Friend: Well, "a simile is like a metaphor" is a simile.
Cueball: Is that simile itself a metaphor for something?
Friend: Maybe it's a metaphor for analogy.
[Cueball and his friend are still sitting and talking while Megan replies from off-panel.]
Cueball: Similes  like metaphors in that they're both analogies.
Megan (off-panel): Analogies are like sandwiches in that I'm making one now.
