[Cueball leaving a public bathroom. A water fountain is next to the bathroom door. An arrow points to the next panel.]
[Cueball drinking from the water fountain. An arrow points to the next panel.]
[Cueball reenters the bathroom. An arrow points back to the first panel.]
I avoid drinking fountains outside bathrooms because I'm afraid of getting trapped in a loop.
