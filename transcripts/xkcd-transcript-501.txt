[Over the left side of the main panel, below the middle, is a small panel partly outside the main one. The comic begins inside this panel where a devil drawn like Cueball, but with two small horns on his forehead is shown from the waist up, raising one hand while moving into the main panel. In the caption below we learn that the devil is Mephistopheles.]

[In the main panel, with all drawings right of the smaller one, we see the mortal, Cueball, sitting at his desk typing on his laptop. Mephistopheles, now drawn in full figure, has stopped before a sign on a stick in the floor reading is out loud while pointing at it with one hand and holding the other hand in front of his mouth. The text on the sign is visible but unreadable in it self.]
Cueball: Read the sign.
Mephistopheles: 
Mephistopheles: Wait, you can't-
Cueball: Too late.
