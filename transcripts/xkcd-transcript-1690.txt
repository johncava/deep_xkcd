[This comic shows a pie chart with 5 slices, each with a label and a line pointing to these five different sized slices. There is a caption above the chart:]

[The labels on each slice is given in clockwise order starting top left. The percentages are estimated from the image and are noted in the square brackets before the transcript:]
[38%]: Going through the Star Wars movies and digitally replacing all the lightsabers with regular metal swords
[16%]: Reading every entry in the Wikipedia article 
[23%]: Installing and configuring time-tracking software
[02%]: Actual productive work
[21%]: Making a remix of that  song where every line is just "Suckin' on a chili dog outside the tastee-freez" over and over
[Below the frame there is a caption:]
Time-tracking software shines an uncomfortably harsh light on my daily life.
