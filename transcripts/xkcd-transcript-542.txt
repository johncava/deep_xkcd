[Black Hat looking slightly up is holding two rags stained red with blood while Danish is holding an equally bloody mop.]
Black Hat: Okay, got the blood off the walls. 
Danish: I finished the floor.
[Black Hat drops the bloody rags behind him while looking up at the ceiling, Danish has put the bloody mop behind her leaning against the wall while covering her mouth with her hands.]
Black Hat: Good; he'll be home any-
Black Hat: Oh crap! We forgot to clean the ceiling!
[Black Hat has moved away from the bloody rags towards Danish who has taken her hands down. They look straight at each other. The bloody mop has fallen over on the floor.]
Danish: There's no time!
Black Hat: Wait, I'll handle it.
[Cueball with briefcase enters the house through the front door behind him, still standing open. He is greeted by Black Hat holding out a hand towards him. The corner of the room and the wall behind them and past the door is outlines with three lines connecting in the corner.]
Black Hat: Hi. Did you know "gullible" is written on your ceiling?
Cueball: Hah. Yeah, right.
