[A woman, looking like Megan, walks up to a group of people watching TV. Cueball and Megan (with shorter hair than the walking woman) are sitting on a couch. A Cueball-like guy sits in front of them, while Ponytail lies on the ground, head resting on a hand, in front of a TV, which is quite far from the couch.]
Woman: Morning. How's the game?
Cueball: Eagles got to the 26-yard line around midnight.  They've been walking across the field since then.  Just entered a huddle.
Megan: I bet the next frame will be a cut.
Guy on floor: You always say that.
Ponytail: Do you think the first ads will come by the end of February?

I'm at a year-round Super Bowl watch party. We're playing the stream at / speed, so it will end just as next year's Super Bowl starts.
