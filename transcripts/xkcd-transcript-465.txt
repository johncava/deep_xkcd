Reporter: So, Quantum Teleportation-
Cueball: The name is misleading. It's a particle statistics thing.

Reporter: So it's not like Star Trek? That's boring.

Cueball: Okay, I'm sick of this. Every time there's a paper on quantum teleportation, you reporters write the same disappointed story.

Reporter (Off panel): But-

[Inserted panel with a zoom in on the device which is labeled and the knob is now turned to the right position. Both possible positions are labeled.]
Label: Teleporter
Left: Quantum
Right: Regular
[Cueball is beamed up in classic Star Trek fashion.]
