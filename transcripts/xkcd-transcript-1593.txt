Beret Guy: For those just joining us, hi! We're on part 5 of a hitting game.
[Zoom out with Beret guy shown from the side sitting at a desk.]
Beret Guy: The next guy has a big bat, so he'll probably hit the ball real far.
Beret Guy: Wait - he missed!
Beret Guy: Oh good, they're letting him try again.
[Zoom in again on Beret Guy still seen from the side.]
Beret Guy: The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy but he's ignoring them. Wow.
Beret Guy: Rude.
[Beret guy looks straight out.]
Beret Guy: This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them.
Beret Guy: It's just him, though. None of his teammates are joining in.
[Beret guy turns his head to the side.]
Beret Guy: 
Beret Guy: Everyone's real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there's nothing that says he can't do that.
Beret Guy: Yikes. Hopefully they can fix that once this game is over.
