Lecturer: And therefore, based on the existence of a Hamiltonian path, we can prove that the routing algorithm gives the optimal result in all cases.
Cueball: Oh my God.
[Close-up of Cueball.]
Offscreen: What? What is it?
Cueball: A sudden rush of perspective. What am I doing here? Life is so much bigger than this!
[Cueball running out of room.]
Cueball: I have to go.
[Cueball enters darkened room, where Megan waits by window.]
[Cueball and Megan embrace...]
[...and get into bed.]
[A heart appears over the supine bodies.]
Megan: Ohh...

Cueball (out of frame): Wait a moment.
Megan (out of frame): What is it?
[Silence.]
Cueball (out of frame): His proof only holds if there's a Hamiltonian  as well as a path!
Megan (out of frame): ...excuse me?
Cueball (out of frame): Paper, I need some paper. Hey, do you mind if I jot down some notes on your chest?
