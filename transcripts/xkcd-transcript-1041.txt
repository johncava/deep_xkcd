[A Revolutionary War soldier gives orders to two others hunkered down behind a rock.]
Lead soldier: Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes
Lead: And smell the scent of their hair.
[The two others getting an incredulous look on their faces.]
Lead: And taste the sweetness of their lips.
[They begin taking fire from the opposition.]
Lead: And feel the heat of their skin pressed against yours, trembling as you-
Soldier 2: Maybe we should just start shooting.
Lead: Right, yes.
