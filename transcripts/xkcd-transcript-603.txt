[Cueball is standing in front of three shelves with DVDs, holding a single DVD in his hand looking at the cover. A guy with a white rounded safari hat (Safari Hat from now on) stands behind him.]
Cueball:  is so true.
Safari Hat: I know, right? It used to be that the intelligent, upper classes had more children.
[Zoom on on their heads as Cueball turns towards Safari Hat.]
Safari Hat: Sadly, the recent reversal of this trend has dragged IQ scores and average education steadily downward.
Cueball: Depressing, huh?
[Zoom out to show Cueball holding the DVD down as Safari Hat lifts on arm towards him.]
Safari Hat: Yeah, except 
Cueball: Huh?
Safari Hat: Wrong. False. The opposite of true.
[Zoom in only on Safari Hat.]
Safari Hat: You're like the religious zealots who are  by their superiority with the sad duty of decrying the  moral decay of each new generation.
Safari Hat: And you're just as wrong.
[Zoom out to both as before, but this time it is Cueball who holds up a finger.]
