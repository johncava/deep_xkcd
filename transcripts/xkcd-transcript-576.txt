[Cueball is sitting at his computer.]
Cueball: I love getting packages.
[Megan enters and Cueball turns towards her.]
Cueball: I set up a script to search eBay et. al. for $1 items with free shipping.
[Cueball comes home with a backpack on his back and find a package waiting for him on his doorstop.]
Cueball: I gave it $365, so each day it can buy me something random.
[Cueball, again sitting at his computer.]
Megan (off-screen): What if you just end up with lots of crap?
Cueball: I'll give it away. 
Cueball: But I'm sure I'll end up with some interesting stuff.
[The next five panels have a caption in a black frame at the top. The caption is written first for each panel. In the first panel Cueball has unpacked a hose. The paper lies in tatters on the floor. Megan stands next to him.]
Day 1: Length of rubber hose
Cueball: Could be handy around the house.
[Cueball stands with a black item and the torn paper it came in. Megan looks on.]
Day 2: Ski mask
Cueball: It's spring, but hey.
[Cueball is standing alone with a bear trap and the box it came in on the floor.]
Day 3: Bear trap
Cueball: Huh.
[Megan is back as Cueball looks at a piece of paper that came in an envelope.]
Day 4: Tourist map of the Pentagon.
Megan: Uh oh.
[Cueball is standing alone with a bottle of lube in one hand and the box it came in in the other hand.]
Day 5: Lube
Cueball: I'm stopping this before I end up on every F.B.I. watch list ever.
