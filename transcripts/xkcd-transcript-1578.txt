[Cueball is approaching a stump with a squirrel perched on it. A ringing noise is coming from the squirrel's back.]
Squirrel: Riiiiing
Squirrel: Riiiiiing
[Cueball has picked up the squirrel and is holding it to his left ear.]
Cueball: Hello?
[The squirrel bites Cueball's head.]
Squirrel: Chomp!
Cueball: Ow!
[Cueball holds his hand to his cheek while the squirrel leaps away, fleeing.]
