[A flowchart.]
I should cook more! --> Buy ingredients --> Put some in a pan --> Cook --> Does it taste good? --> (arrows marked "Kinda" and "No" both lead to) Put leftovers in fridge --> (hours pass) --> Order pizza --> (days pass) --> Throw away leftovers --> (weeks pass) --> Throw away remaining ingredients as they go bad --> (months pass) --> (arrow leads back to beginning)
