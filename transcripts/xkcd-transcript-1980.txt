[A person wearing a cap, a fur coat, and gloves sits in a sled handing over a plate with small cubic pieces on it to a small boy with dark hair standing beneath. The boy reaches one hand to the plate.]
Person in the sled: Have some Turkish delight. If you betray your family, there's more where that came from.
[The boy tastes one piece.]
[The boy looks at that piece.]
[The boy looks up, to the direction where the gift came from, the piece still in his hands.]
Boy: Wow.
Boy: This is...
Boy: not great.
[Caption below:]
The  books gave me a really unrealistic impression of how good Turkish delight tastes.
