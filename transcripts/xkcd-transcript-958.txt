[Cueball is sitting at a desk with a laptop, looking at a review website]
Cueball: What's with this negative review? You  that hotel.
Black Hat: I have a script that posts a bad review for every hotel I stay at. It reduces demand, which means more vacancies and lower prices next time.
Cueball: What if the place sucks?
Black Hat: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.
Cueball: You punish companies you like!
Black Hat: The odds of  review putting a hotel out of business are negligible.
Cueball: If we all did that the system would collapse!
Black Hat: Doesn't affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.
Cueball: That's not even the tragedy of the commons anymore. That's the tragedy of you're a dick.
Black Hat: If you're quick with a knife, you'll find that the invisible hand is made of delicious invisible meat.
