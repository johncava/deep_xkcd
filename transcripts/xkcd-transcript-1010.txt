Cueball: Earthquake!
Ponytail: We should get to a higher ground - There could be a tidal wave.
[Cueball takes a pedantic pose]
Cueball: You mean a tsunami. "Tidal wave" means a wave caused by tides.
[A crash is heard, followed by Etymology-Man flying in while wearing a cape.]
Etymology-man: You know, that doesn't add up.
Cueball and Ponytail: Etymology-man!
[Etymology-man takes a pedantic pose.]
Etymology-man: What  "tidal wave" mean? There are waves caused by tides, but they're "tidal bores", and they're not cataclysmic.
It can refer to the daily tide cycle, but that's obviously not what people mean when they say "a tidal wave hit".
It's been obvious for centuries that these waves come from quakes. So why "tidal"?
Etymology-man: Remember that until 2004, there weren't any clear photos or videos of tsunamis. Some modern writers even described them rearing up and breaking like surfing waves.
Of course, in 2004 and 2011, it was made clear to everyone that a tsunami is more like a rapid, turbulent, inrushing tide - exactly what historical accounts describe.
[Water begins to rush in. Etymology-man keeps his pedantic pose.]
