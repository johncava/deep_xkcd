[A box plot with three vertical data points is shown. Each point consists of a shaded rectangular box, and a T-shaped whisker on each end.]
[Cueball walks in; revealing that the box plot is a physical object which he looks up on.]
[Cueball climbs on top of the diagram, holding onto the top whisker of the leftmost data point.]
[Cueball, now standing upright on top of the box plot, bends over, grips the whisker of the center data point and starts pumping. The shaded box of the data point bulges. Cueball's movements are accompanied by sounds:]



[The box has been inflated so much that it almost touches the left and right data points. Cueball walks away.]
