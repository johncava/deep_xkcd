Megan: Check it out!
Cueball: What?
Megan: I've got Galilean moons!
[Io is at the point in its orbit closest to Cueball.]
Io: Hi!
[Io, which completes a full orbit in each panel, is again near Cueball, as is Europa this time.]
Io: Hi!
Europa: What's your name?
[Io alone again.]
Io: Hi!
[Europa returns to its position near Cueball with Io, and Ganymede joins them.]
Io: Hi!
