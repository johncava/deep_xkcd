[The next part below, further in time, has no pictured item but the text reads:]

[Next below a larger sandwich is shown.]
[And below again an even larger sandwich is shown. The text to the right is:]

[On the left side, representing small food sizes, the text embedded in arrows pointing to every direction is:]
Void
[Below of that an enormously large sandwich is shown. The text is:]

[More below a new row on the left for small sizes comes up, inside is a panini. The text reads:]

[Below of all the two paths may converge, indicated by two arrows pointing downwards and slightly together. The final text reads:]
