[Cueball is talking to Black Hat. Black Hat is using a laptop.]
Cueball: They said on the news that they found a giant ring lying in a field outside Chicago. Strung with some kind of superstrong mesh.
Black Hat: Mhm?
Cueball: Then they found a 260 mile long shaft connected to the ring, running from Chicago to St. Louis. In St. Louis they found a gigantic winch.
Black Hat: Did they.
Cueball: It sounds kind of like...
Cueball: ...a butterfly net.
Cueball: ...are you planning on catching the International Space Station?
Black Hat: I'm planning to catch  international space station.
