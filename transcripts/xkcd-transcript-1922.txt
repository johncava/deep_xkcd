Beret Guy: Interferometry. Is so cool!
[They stop and Beret Guy is holding the leashes in his hand. He has taken them off the dogs and points at the dogs, which he has placed facing outward so they are standing a couple of paces apart. The distance between them is indicated by a labeled line.]

The invisible giant dog barks from a position just in front of Beret Guy's face, far above the two small dogs.]
