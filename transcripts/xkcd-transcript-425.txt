[Megan to the left, Cueball to the right and Blondie in the middle are sitting on chairs around a table with lots of small stuff on it. A few small white items are standing up. All three are reading from the piece of paper they each hold up in their hands (Megan only using one hand). Below them there is a caption inside the panel.]
Megan: "The ones you love will never let you down."
Cueball: "Seek nonviolence in everything you do."
Blondie: "Your self-confidence is well-placed."
Instead of "In bed", I've found that fortune cookies are often more improved by appending " in bed".
