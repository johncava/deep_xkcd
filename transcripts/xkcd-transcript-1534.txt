[Cueball and Hairy standing in front of a fridge.]
Hairy: What do you drink? Stouts? Lagers?
Cueball: Uh, anything's fine.
[Cueball and Hairy holding beers and Hairy is drinking.]
Cueball: ...do you ever think maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?
[Now Cueball drinks.]
Hairy: Man, you are  fun at all.
Cueball: Ok, got it. Not a word.
Hairy: Dude, if you don't like it, don't drink it.
Cueball: No, no, gotta do my part! Mmmmm!!!
