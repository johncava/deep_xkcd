Hairy: I saw a cute girl outside the bank today. She looked nice.
Cueball: Oh no, not again. You are the  judge of these things.
Hairy: But she was so sweet. Shy, but there was something in her eyes. A pain down in her soul, the same as the one down in mine.
Cueball: Mm hmm.
Hairy: The police light played through her mohawk like the sun setting through pine trees as she shoveled the third hooker into the trunk of the camry...
Cueball: Back up.
