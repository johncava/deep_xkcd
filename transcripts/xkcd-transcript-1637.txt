[Hairbun (with glasses), Ponytail, Megan and Cueball are in a salt mine. Hairbun and Ponytail talk in front of what appears to be a control console for a particle detector with a chair on each side. To the right Megan and Cueball are eating salt in large amounts straight of the rocks in the mine. They are eating so fast that salt spills from their hands and falls to the ground.]
Hairbun: So you've built this particle detector in a salt mine to block out cosmic rays?
Ponytail: Yes.
Ponytail: That is definitely why.
Cueball and Megan [eating salt]: Homf nomf nomf
