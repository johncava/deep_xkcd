Cueball: Dude, you should get on MySpace.
Black Hat: Eh, I don't think so.
Cueball: C'mon. There's no real reason not to except snobbiness. It's the new social scene.
Black Hat: I know. I'm just not interested.
Cueball: Please? I'll friend you.
Black Hat: Carebearstare.
Cueball: What?
[Black Hat shoots a rainbow colored ray from his chest - the Care Bear Stare. It throws Cueball to the edge of the panel, pinned to the wall.]
