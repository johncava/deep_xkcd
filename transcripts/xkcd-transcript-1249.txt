While keeping pets inside may be reasonable on days when fireworks are let off in the beginning of a new year, no regular meteor shower poses much danger to pets.
Apparently a play on the  in mammalian hearts, or possibly on bicuspid teeth. The mention of "Region 2" is a reference to , a digital rights management (DRM) scheme intended to restrict media to certain areas.  DRM of course does not apply to natural events.  However, meteor showers are also geographically restricted, and the visible area might roughly coincide with a DRM region (Though Region 2 covers a large and scattered area, not being strictly geographical).
Since indoor lights and window glass make them harder to see, it would take a  bright meteor (like the Chelyabids two entries below) to be visible without going outside.
This fictional shower would collect shooting stars into the origin to prepare for the real  meteor shower associated with Halley's comet and  from  in Aquarius; the real shower peaks around May 6th.
Due to perspective, meteor showers appear to radiate outwards from a certain point in the sky. Meteor showers may be seen to converge on a point on the opposite side of the sky, but with the earth in the way there would only be a few visible going past the edge, seen as nearly parallel streaks overhead, so the convergence point would hardly be notable.
A reference to the February 15, 2013,  whose explosion shattered windows within a large radius.
A meteor large enough to reach the lower atmosphere could produce sound audible to observers on the ground, but this is very unusual.
This shower is mostly observed via its effects on radio and TV signals, and therefore a good target for conspiracy theorists responding to .
The "50/50 mix of meteors and shooting stars" is a joke, as "meteor" and "shooting star" are synonymous.
This is saying that they are indistinguishable from stars, or that the stars themselves are actually meteors.
 are a family of dinosaurs containing the genus , well-known from the movie Jurassic Park in which they are presented as a deadly menace, fast and especially intelligent to the point of understanding how to open a door; this representation of Velociraptors is a .
Erupting from the ground is the funny inverse of falling from the sky, what meteors always do.
Probably a reference to , a type of neuron.  The "tau" reference has two possibilities.  The "visible even when eyes are closed" could refer to the Tau particle, a heavy sibling of the electron.  When they traveled outside of Earth's magnetosphere on their way to the Moon, Apollo astronauts saw flashes of light about every three minutes even with their eyes closed; these were caused by high energy particles (cosmic rays) penetrating their eyes and brain.  The other possibility is that it refers to , a normal structural protein within brain neurons.  In Alzheimer's Disease, abnormal Tau proteins can aggregate within pyramidal cells to form insoluble skeins.  The number of these "" roughly correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment.
This may have something to do with the fact that "draconids" etymologically means "of the dragon", which could make for a fearsome meteor shower. And if you run it will track you down, albeit slowly. This may also be a reference to , a character in the Mario series of video games that is slow but follows you if you turn your back on them.
As noted in , the Orion constellation (in which the Orionids are located) has a 'dong'. Possibly a joke about a . Maybe.
There  a very active Leonid shower (a "meteor storm") in 1966, and a precursor to it in 1965. The article  was published in  on April 8 of 1966.  Perhaps this suggests that the meteors killed God earlier in the year when they and He were further out in the solar system?
May possibly be a reference to the video game , wherein the main character Sora claims he will 'beat [meteors] back into space' with a wooden sword.
