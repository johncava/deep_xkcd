[A picture of Megan wearing aviator goggles, sitting in an autogyro and holding the control stick. The autogyro is surrounded by sentence fragments, explaining characteristics of it. The one above the blade that concerns the blade has an arrow pointing from the text to the blade. The sentences in columns from the left (i.e. first four sentences to the left, then two above the autogyro's body, and finally six sentences to the right):]
Looks like a helicopter, but is nothing like a helicopter
Flies like a plane but is nothing like a plane
Sort of like a powered parachute
Rare in the US, usually homemade. Common in Europe.
Big blade on top is not powered and spins freely
Can often be flown without a license
Cheap
Needs a runway to take off, but not a long one
Can land vertically
Cannot hover
Never stalls
Extremely safe, unless you do the  thing you instinctively do to escape a stall in a normal airplane, in which case it will crash immediately.
