[At the top of a map is a heading, with two sub headings and a note in brackets:]

Without the space
The Solar System's solid surfaces stitched together
(Excluding dust and small rocks)
[Below the headings there is a map with several distinct areas. Each area is labelled with a name or a description. This label is noted inside the area, except for areas that are too small; here the label is written outside and a line indicates which area the label belongs to. Only exception is the largest area, on which the contours of the Earth's continents are drawn. Surrounding the map is wavy lines to indicate that this is either an island or one big super-continent placed in an even larger ocean.]
[Here below are the labels given as they appear in "normal" reading order in as read from left to right in the three main rows as will be indicated:]
[Row one, above the line defined by the general top of the Earth area:]
Io
Callisto
Europa
Ganymede
Ceres
Vesta
Asteroids (1 km+)
