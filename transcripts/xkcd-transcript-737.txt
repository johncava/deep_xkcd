[Cueball is holding a yogurt cup at arm's length. Waves of stink are rising from it.]
Cueball: Oh God, how old is this yogurt in your fridge?
[Someone speaks from off-panel.]
Person: What's the expiration date?
[Cueball holds up the cup to look at the bottom.]
Cueball: May 12th, but there's no year.
[From off-panel again.]
Person: It's May 7th. So it's fine.
[Now the second person is on panel, and Cueball speaks from off-panel. The second person is sitting down working on a laptop.]
Cueball: I'm not sure. When it was packaged, was civilization using the Gregorian or Julian calendar?
Person:  I'll throw it out.
Cueball: No, it might still be good!
