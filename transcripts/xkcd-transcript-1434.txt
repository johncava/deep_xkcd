[The comic is separated into three sections, with Cueball and Megan having a discussion in the first section, websites found through Google search results depicted in the second, and a bird depicted in the third.]

Cueball: "Where do birds go when it rains?" is my new favorite Google search.
Megan [off screen]: Why?
Cueball: It gives the answer, but also shows you an endless torrent of other people asking the same question. Pages and pages of them across regions and cultures.
[Megan enters the frame and shows interest in the computer.]
Cueball: I love the idea that somehow this is the universal question, the thing that unites us. When it rains, we wonder where the birds go, and hope they're staying dry.

:  I've noticed I rarely see birds flying around or in trees or on power lines when it's raining, So where do they go?
