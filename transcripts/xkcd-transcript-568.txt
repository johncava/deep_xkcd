[Four people are lined up by a covered well, Ponytail in front followed by Cueball, Megan and a man with some kind of hat (could be Beret Guy, but only half of his head is shown so it is not clear). A large sign stands well in front of the well. Ponytail throws in a coin.]
Well: Science may discover immortality, but it won't happen in the next eighty years.
Sign: The Uncomfortable Truths Well.
[Zoom in on the well and Cueball who throws in a coin.]
Well: You'll never find a programming language that frees you from the burden of clarifying your ideas.
Cueball: But  know what I mean!
[Same zoom in on Megan who throws in a coin.]
Well: You avoid your friend Mike because you're uncomfortably attracted to him.
[Megan bend in over the well looking down]
Megan: Nice try, Mike.
Megan: Get out of the well.
Mike (from inside the well): Aww.
