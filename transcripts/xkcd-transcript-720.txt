[Person 1 looks down at their bowl. They have a cup with what appears to be a lump of coal in it.]
Person 1: I've got... Cheerios with a shot of vermouth.
[Person 2 has a plate with some kind of cubic food on it. They have a cup of what appears to be two lovebirds in it.]
Person 2: At least it's better than the quail eggs in whipped cream and MSG from last time.
[Person 3 has a plate with a several lumps of some form of white stuff on it. They have a cup of what appears to be some kind of superfluid flowing out of it.]
Person 3: Are these Skittles ?
