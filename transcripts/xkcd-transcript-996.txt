[Ponytail in a doctor's coat is carrying a clipboard with lines indicating text, consulting it while Megan is sitting on a high medical table with a full body gown on. At the top there is a frame crossing over the top frame with a caption:]
Breast Cancer Surgery Follow-Up...
Ponytail: You're looking great! Remove your top so I can check how the incision is healing.
Megan: Nuh-uh.
[Ponytail has taken her arm with the clipboard down, while Megan is holding her hand with a thumb up.]
Ponytail: *Sigh*. 
Ponytail: Do we have to do this  time?
Megan: You know the rules.
[In a frame-less panel showing only Ponytail, she searches for something in both her pockets, three sets of two small lines indicate how she moves her hands around inside them.]
Ponytail: This is so ridiculous.
[Ponytail holds a purple bead necklace up in an outstretched arm. Megan begins to disrobe, opening the dress at her neck pulling with both arms as shown with three sets of two small lines.]
Ponytail: Here.
Megan: Woooo!
