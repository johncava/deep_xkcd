[A simple flowchart is shown. The text above the panel reads:]
Evolution of my understanding of color over time:
[On the left side is a vertical dashed line in gray, on top it's labeled:]

[And at the bottom the label reads:]

[Header above the chart:]
"Color" is...
[The chart starts with three items, one left and an other on the right, a third is below in the middle.]
...three primary colors mixed together
...a rainbow, and each color is a wavelength
...unknowable ("maybe what  see as blue,  see as...")
[Arrows from the left and the middle item point to a new left one, while two other arrows from the middle and the right item lead to one at the right.]
...three-ish primary colors mixed together (RGB/RYB/CMYK)
...a mix of infinite wavelengths filtered through three eye pigments
[The arrows of both items point to one in the middle:]
(something about the opponent color model)
[The remaining items are all in the middle and each is connected by one arrow downwards to the next.]
...an abstract multidimensional gamut (CIE 1931, L*a*b*, etc)
...an abstract multidimensional gamut filtered through inconsistently-implemented device color profiles
...a hyperdimensional four-sided quantum Klein manifold? Is that a thing?
...hopefully somebody else's problem.
