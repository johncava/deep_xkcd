[A guy and Cueball are engaged in a fight with laser pistols. The guy is standing behind a small box, firing his gun at Cueball.]
[Cueball is kneeling behind a larger box, returning fire.]
[The guy leaps on top of the larger box, knocking Cueball backwards and off balance. Cueball fires wildly into the air.]
[Now the guy is standing on the box. Cueball is sprawled on the ground, laser pistol out of reach, at gunpoint.]
Guy: Any last words?
Cueball: "Apollo retroreflectors."
Guy: What?
[The guy gets shot in the back by the returning beam of Cueball's wild shot.]
