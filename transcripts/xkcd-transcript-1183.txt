[Cueball enters a living room, to see a line of red rose petals on the floor.]
[Cueball follows the line of rose petals.]
[Cueball observes that the line of rose petals leads out the front door, onto the street, and along the sidewalk.]
[The rose petals leads up to a table fan behind what appears to be an inverted mailbox filled with rose petals with its back removed. Both are sitting on a Roomba which is motoring down the sidewalk. The fan is on, and is blowing the rose petals out the slit in the front of the mailbox. The contraption is making a sound and the Roomba has its brand written on it]
Whirrrrrr
Roomba
