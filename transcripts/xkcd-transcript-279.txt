 is making a "your sister" joke.
A  is a car, and Cueball is implying that the father is an actual thief.
He adds the word "Screaming," to make the word "running" be literal instead of figurative.
[Cueball at a bar.]
Cueball: If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put your sister and I together.
Cueball: Is your father a thief? Because that's totally my Jetta you parked outside.
Cueball: You must be tired, 'cause you've been running through my mind all night.
Cueball: Screaming.
