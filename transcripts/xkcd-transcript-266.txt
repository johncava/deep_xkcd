[A white Megan floats in a bubble against a dark blue space backdrop. She is at the top of the bubble. Her thoughts (not connected to her by a speak line) are shown above her in white.]
Megan (thinking): I should feel scared.
[She falls from the top of the bubble, the bubble rises, or both.]
Megan (thinking): But I don't.
[She hits the bottom of the bubble, and the bubble begins to fall down.]
Megan (thinking): Maybe this is a dream.
[She floats over the top of the now still bubble.]
Megan (thinking): But it doesn't feel like one.
[She now floats in the middle of the still bubble, in a larger panel. The sky behind her now has many stars and light effect. A voice speaks from off-panel above.]
Voice (off panel): Okay, found you.
Megan: Who are you?
Voice (off panel): Er, hang on. 
Voice (off panel): This next part might be a little weird.
[Beat panel, where Megan just floats in her bubble on the same background, but in a smaller panel.]
[A large panel where many distorted copies of Megan whirl around the original Megan in her bubble; she also bends backwards. The stars and light display in the background is more clear around her bubble, that now creates a lens effect, that even distorts the distorted Megans even more. Around her bubbles edge and the lens edge, there are three places where brown lines appear on both these edges.]
[All the copies have disappeared except for one who is hanging suspended outside Megan in her bubble. The new one is almost a mirror image, but not quite. The background is more dark blue, with fewer features.]
[The Megan copy raises her hand and speaks. There are again more stars in the background.]
