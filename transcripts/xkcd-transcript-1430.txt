[Cueball is talking with Megan.]
Cueball: What do you do?
Megan: I make software that predicts how proteins will fold.
Cueball: Is that a hard problem?
Megan: Someone may someday find a harder one.
Cueball: Why is it so hard?
Megan: Have you ever made a folded paper crane?
Cueball: Yeah.
Megan: Imagine figuring out the folds to make an actual  crane.
Cueball: ... folds? Can I make cuts?
Megan: If you can fold a protease enzyme.
