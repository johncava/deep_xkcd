[Caption above the panel:]
Sometimes my conversations with strangers go on for a while before I realize that they're talking on their phones.
[To the right above a graph Cueball is standing next to a Cueball-like guy with a backpack.]
Guy with backpack: Hi!
Cueball: Hi.
Guy with backpack: What's up?
Cueball: Uh, not a lot...
Guy with backpack: Shit. Does Bernanke own a crossbow?
[To the left and below these two guys is a graph, with the axis labelled. The graph looks parabolic towards the left-hand side, but as x approaches infinity, y approaches zero. A vertical dashed line runs through the graph, slightly to the right of the peak of the graph.  To the right of the dashed line there is an arrow pointing to the right that is labelled. The x-axis has a broken scale, and to the right of the break there is a very small increase in the graph that is parenthetically labelled with a small arrow.]
Y-axis: How Often This Happens
X-axis: Length of conversation
Arrow: Awkward Zone
Small arrow: (My Second Relationship)
