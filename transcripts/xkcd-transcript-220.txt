[Megan sits on a chair for two panels without moving.]
[In the third panel, Megan has still not moved but makes the following comment to no one in particular.]
Megan: If the question of what it all means doesn't mean anything, why do I keep coming back to it? 
[Two Cueball-like friends of Megan are talking to each other. One of them is standing behind the office chair in which the other friend is sitting, behind a desk with a computer. The standing friend starts to walk toward Megan. The sitting friend pulls a large yellow and green super soaker from a drawer.]
Standing friend: She's getting existential again.
Sitting friend: It's okay, I have a super soaker.
