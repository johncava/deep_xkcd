[Three people around a computer. One of them is typing.]
Typing: Hey, party tonight?
Typing: We'd all like to come see your new place!
Reply (through monitor): Wait, what?
[Cut to guy sitting at a laptop.]
Reply (through the guy's monitor): We want to hang out!
Guy typing: We're not, like, good friends.
Reply (through the guy's monitor): I know, but we were thinking about it and we really like you!
[Cut back to the three friends.]
Typing: You should have us over tonight!
Typing: For, like, an hour.
Typing: It'll be fun!
Reply (through monitor): Well, uh, sure.
[Cut to color-inverted image of the guy's house. Four Enlightened-controlled Ingress portals are in the guy's back yard.]
Friends (off-screen): 
Guy (from inside his house): I still don't get why you're suddenly so excited to hang out.
