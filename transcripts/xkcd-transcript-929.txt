[Two Cueball-like guys are playing basketball. The right guy (Cueball) attempts to throw the basketball through the hoop, but it bounces off down to his friend. To the right Black Hat has his back to the other two while he is looking at his phone.]
Friend: Do you seriously think  will move to Plus? It was hard enough getting them on Facebook.
[The friend has caught the rebound and now passes the basketball back to Cueball. Black Hat is not shown.]
Cueball: Do they have to?
