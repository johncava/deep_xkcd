White Hat: We've discovered that your company doesn't do anything.
Beret Guy: How is that possible?! We have so many chairs!
White Hat: You need to find an industry to disrupt.
Beret Guy: An...industry?
Beret Guy: Oh, yeah!
Beret Guy: The zoning thing from SimCity!
White Hat: No, like, a kind of business.
Beret Guy: How do I find those?
White Hat: I don't know. What's something you spend a lot of money on?
Beret Guy: You know those mysterious shops that sell you magical items, and then it turns out they're cursed, but when you go back later there's no sign the shop was ever there?
Beret Guy: I get most of my stuff from those.
Beret Guy: Like groceries.
Hairy: We should go.
Hairbun: Wait. High-value sales, no regulation, and when customers try to complain, they can't find you...
Cueball: Maybe this  the perfect startup.
