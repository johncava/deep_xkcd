[Beret Guy is shown in silhouette. Above Beret Guy there is a black sign with white (and grey) text. Above this is his address to those in the meeting:]
Beret Guy: Welcome to a meeting! I'm almost out of words, so I'll keep this short. Just wanna touch bases.
[White text in the black sign ( in grey):]
CompanyName.website


[Beret Guy stands in front of an office chair and a table talking.]
Beret Guy: First, a few updates. We've learned from the state police that the self-driving car project we launched by accident during this morning's carpool has come to an end about 90 miles outside of town. Very exciting!
[Pony tail sits at the table.]
Beret Guy [off-panel]: Profits are up. Sales, any luck figuring out who our customers are?
Ponytail: Nope. Money keeps appearing, but we have no idea how or why.
Beret Guy [off-panel]: Great!
[Back to the situation from frame two.]
