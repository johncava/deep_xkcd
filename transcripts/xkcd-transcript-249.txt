[Cueball sits at a desk with glue, chess pieces, and a chessboard while a friend looks over his shoulder.]
Friend: What are you doing?
Cueball: Gluing down chess pieces.
Friend: Why?
Cueball: Because there's a picture I've always wanted... I'll need your coat to sneak this onto the ride.
[A photograph of a roller coaster ride with Cueball sitting in the first car, chin in hand, thinking over the chessboard. The photograph has "Mega Coaster 3000 souvenir photo" written on the margin.]
