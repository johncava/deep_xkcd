[White Hat is looking at a smartphone held out by Cueball]
Cueball: I have five phone numbers for you.  Which one should I use?
White Hat: That first one is my cell - you should use the Google Voice one, since it will forward to my laptop if I'm on WiFi.  #5 is my work number, which just forwards to #1.  #3 should always work but can't do texts.
White Hat: You can delete #4. I think.
[Caption under the panel:] Another reason I never call people.
