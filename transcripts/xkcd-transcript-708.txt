[A Cueball-like guy lies on his tummy, and another Cueball-like guy sits to the left with Hairbun siting and Ponytail also lying on her tummy hands beneath her chin to the right on the floor around a game board. On the board is what appears to be two dice.]
Guy lying: I...  the castle guard? That doesn't seem right.
Hairbun: It did 6 damage, though.
