[A black panel with 31 dots of different sizes and in various colors (white, red, yellow, blue and green). These bright dots are scattered around three white speech bubbles for off-panel speakers. Next to the top left corner of the first bubble, there are five dots close together. Two white, two yellow (one brighter than the other) and a red dot that is clearly larger than any of the other four.]
Person 1 (off panel): That cluster was known to the ancients as the Five Sisters.
Person 1 (off panel): The red one is a supergiant and will probably explode within the next million years.
Person 2 (off panel): Wow!

There are too many status LEDs in my room.
