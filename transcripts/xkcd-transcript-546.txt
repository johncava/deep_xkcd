Cueball [typing]: ...and that's why music DRM is bad for listeners  artists!
Megan [off-panel]: What are you doing?
[Megan enters and Cueball turns towards her.]
Megan: In case you didn't notice, we  the music DRM war.  The big stores are DRM free.
[Zoom in on Megan who holds up a hand doing the sign of the horns.]
Megan: So close the comment thread, get out the debit card, buy us some music, and let's rock the fuck out.
[Back to viewing both as in panel 2.]
Cueball: But I don't actually  music, I just like being self-righteous on the web.
Megan: Lucky for you,  will always be free.
