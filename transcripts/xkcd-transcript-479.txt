[Cueball is standing in room next to round table, looking out a window. Blue and orange sunset visible outside the window. There is a phone on the table.]
I haven't lived a perfect life.
Made plenty of mistakes.
Got my share of regrets.
[Viewpoint zooms in onto Cueball and table.]
But there's one thing of which I'm proud.
One stand on which I've never wavered.
[Viewpoint zooms in onto cell phone on table.]
When someone calls my phone,
it makes a goddamn  sound.
