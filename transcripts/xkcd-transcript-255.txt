[A tall slide, seen from the ground.]
When I was a kid, my school playground had a really tall slide that always made me nervous.
[A tall slide, seen from the side.]
We moved away, but the slide stuck in my memory, becoming a skyscraping monster.
[A car and a sign pointing to school zone.]
Years later, I was passing through my old town and remembered the playground.
I drove to the school to see the slide that my inner six-year-old thought was so towering.
[A huge slide, Cueball beside it.]
AND IT  HUGE!
I  IT!
