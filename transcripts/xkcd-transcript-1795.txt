[The comic shows the facades of four stores next to each other on a street, with the sidewalk shown in front of them. To the top of each store's name there has been appended white signs. Three of the white signs partially cover the name part of the sign above three of the stores, but the fourth sign is placed entirely above the text of the third store. Thus that white sign's top is higher up than the building's.]
[First store from the left. The top line of two on the stores sign is obscured by the white sign:] 
White sign: All-you-can-eat
Store sign: Discount Tires
[Second store from the left. The top line of two on the stores sign is obscured by the white sign:]  
White sign: All-you-can-eat
Store sign: Hair Salon
[Third store from the left. The white sign on this store is slightly tilted, and most of it is above the top of the store completely above the store sign:]
White sign: All-you-can-eat
Store sign: Lumber and 
Store sign: Flooring Depot
[Fourth store from the left. The top line of two on the stores sign is obscured by the white sign. However the name can still be deduced and the top line says "Kevin's".]
White sign: All-you-can-eat
Store sign: Pet Store
