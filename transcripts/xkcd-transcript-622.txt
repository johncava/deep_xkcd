If we suppose that there are a finite number of primes, then they must have a product, i.e. ... = . Now consider  + 1. If this number is prime itself, then we have discovered a new prime number, contrary to the assumption that we had listed them all. If it is not prime, it must have a prime divisor. Since all of the  are a factor of , they cannot be a divisor of  + 1. So  + 1 is divisible by a prime not on the list, which again is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes.

[Miss Lenhart teaching a class gestures with both hands up as Megan, sitting at the first desk on a stool, raises a hand and asks a question. Cueball sits at the desks behind her supporting his head in both hands with the elbows on the desk.]
Megan: How do you know there are an infinite number of primes?
Miss Lenhart: I'll answer in haiku!
[In a frame-less panel, Miss Lenhart lifts a hand up while answering. Both students sit upright on their stools.]
Miss Lenhart: Top prime's divisors'
[Miss Lenhart floats into the air  with three lines beneath her legs. Cueball looks up. Megan does not change position.]
Miss Lenhart: Product (plus one)'s factors are...?
[Miss Lenhart flies over the students heads with a curved line behind her. Neither student look up. The bottom frame of the panel is a curving thought/dream bobble that goes through the middle of the panel at a height just below the desk tops. Two thought circles goes from Cueball's head down to this frame, and Cueball's thoughts are shown below outside of the panel - without any frame around.]
Miss Lenhart: Q.E.D., bitches!
Cueball (thinking): Wow, after the 48-hour sleep-dep mark, lectures get  interesting.
