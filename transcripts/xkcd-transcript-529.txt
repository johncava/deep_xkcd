[Megan looks out window through blinds.]
Megan: It's snowing!
Cueball: [from off-screen] Sled time!
[Megan and Cueball outside with sled, at the top of a hill.]
Cueball: It depresses me that I'm too old to learn another language fluently. My brain's solidified.
[Megan and Cueball sledding down the hill.]
Megan: Is there one you wish you knew?
Cueball: No, I just hate having options closed to me. Like I've given up a life that was once possible.
[At the bottom of the hill, sled has stopped.]
Megan: Yeah. Which reminds me - our anniversary is coming up.
Megan: Man, that ride failed to be a metaphor for our conversation.
Cueball: Guess this isn't the Calvin & Hobbes-model toboggan.
