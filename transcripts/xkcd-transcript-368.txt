[Black Hat and Cueball are standing in a room with one window. Black Hat is pushing a box with an elliptical dish on top towards the window.]

Cueball: The bass from that car is driving me nuts.
Black Hat: Me too. Give me a hand here.
[The dish is aimed out the window; Black Hat plugs the device into the wall.]
Cueball: I'm afraid to ask.
Black Hat: The system detects bass rhythms and floods the target with a phase-shifted replica signal.
Black Hat: The resonance should blow out their speakers.
[The side of a building. The dish of the device is visible through a window, emitting sound waves.]


[Back in the room.]
Black Hat: Speakers down. Now flip that red switch.
[Cueball does so with a "click."]
[Back to the outside view, more sound waves.]

Cueball: You're horrifying.
Black Hat: Okay, now throw the switch labeled "Macarena".
