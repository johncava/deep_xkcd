Cueball: Everyone loves these eagles that take down drones, but ... I dunno.
Megan: You gotta admit, it's pretty cool.

Cueball: At some point, it's like releasing police dogs onto freeways to attack speeding motorcycles.
Megan: Also cool, but I see your point.

Black Hat: Plus, I just finished my autonomous drone that hunts eagles.
Cueball: Man,  are an entirely separate class of problem.
