The future
[Cueball is sitting at a futuristic desktop computer with the curved screen and keyboard both floating above the table, and a girl with pigtails is standing behind him with a portable ultra-thin screen. She shows the screen to Cueball. On it is a man with dark hair.]
Girl: Hey dad, look at this old music video.
Video: We're no strangers to love...
Cueball: Wow, you got me.
[The girl now looks at the device.]
Girl: Did your generation really use this to troll people?  lame. You know, you guys  at pranks.
[The girl is holding the device down along her legs as Cueball turns from his computer and addresses her.]
Cueball: Did we? I once raised a kid with conditioning so her speech centers shut down when she was upset.
[The girl has dropped the device on the floor and are fisting her hands. Cueball has turned back and are typing on the keyboard.]
Girl: What? No, you couldn't have bleegle warble yargle arrgh!
Cueball: Teehee.
