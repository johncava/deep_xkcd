[Cueball is walking up to Ponytail who sits at her desk in an office chair typing on her computer.]
Cueball: How are you doing?
Ponytail: Hah.
Cueball: You seem distant lately. For the past few months.
Ponytail: Can't  why.
[Cueball talks to Ponytail at her desk from off-panel.]
Cueball (off-panel): Your projects have stagnated.
Ponytail: But my Stardew Valley farm is doing . 
Cueball (off-panel): You can't just hide from everything. 
Ponytail: : Mostly false.
[In a frame-less panel Cueball is seen standing behind Ponytail at her desk.]
Cueball: I'm glad you're including more comments in your code, but it would be nice if they were comments  your code. 
Cueball: Or at least a bit less obscenity-filled.
Ponytail: Look, they say to write what you know.
[Cueball leans forward towards Ponytail at her desk (who has looked on the screen in the same position through the entire comic).]
Cueball: All the functions you've written take everything passed to them and return it unchanged with the comment "No,  deal with this."
Ponytail: It's a functional programming thing. Avoiding side effects.
Cueball: You avoid  effects. 
Ponytail: Only way to be sure.
