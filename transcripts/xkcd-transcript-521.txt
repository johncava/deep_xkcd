The 2008 XKCD Christmas Special
Due to the slowing economy, we could only afford to produce the prime-numbered panels.
You should be able to infer the missing parts of the story easily enough.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
[The first panel is blank.]
[Megan carrying Christmas lights and Cueball watching.]
Megan: I'm going to one-up those Christmas light displays on YouTube.
[Megan thinking.]
Megan: Hmm. Needs more flair. Do you know what happens when you fire sodium pellets into a snowbank?
Cueball: No.
Megan: Me neither.
[The next panel is blank.]
[Megan sitting in front of a console.]
Megan: Whoops, one of the Arduino control boards sublimated.
Megan: If only I could make it self-repairing...
[The next panel is blank.]
Megan: Shit. The system has become sentient.
Cueball: Friggin' Python.
System: GRAAARR!
[The next three panels are blank.]
[Megan showing laptop to Cueball.]
Megan: But according to this email forward, Santa is secretly a Muslim!
Cueball: It explains everything!
[The next panel is blank.]
Megan: Okay, the cloned raptors are hunting the last of the cyborgs. We're safe.
Cueball: Are you sure you thought this through?
[The next three panels are blank.]
[Two couples appear in this next panel.]
Cueball: Are the raptors contained?
Ponytail: Sure. Unless they figure out how to build lightsabers.
[The next panel is blank.]
[Guy with hat fighting with a raptor using lightsabers.]
Cueball: It's all right. I've got her.
[Lightsaber appears from behind.]
Snap-hiss!
Cueball: ...Clever girl.
[The next three panels are blank.]
[Bill Gates is holding a weapon over Santa's body. The two girls are watching.]
Megan: Great. Bill Gates kills Santa.
Bill Gates: I thought it was Stallman with a dyed beard.
[The next five panels are blank.]
[Megan and Black Hat are looking at a tree.]
Megan: Where did you get this Christmas tree?
Black Hat: Nowhere.
Megan: Did you cut down the Yggdrasil?
Black Hat: ...Maybe.
[The next panel is blank.]
[Megan and Cueball holding hands and looking at reader.]
