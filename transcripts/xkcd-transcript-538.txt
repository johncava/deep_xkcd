A Crypto nerd's imagination:
[Cueball is holding a laptop, and his friend is examining it.]
Cueball: His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a million-dollar cluster to crack it.
Friend: No good! It's 4096-bit RSA!
Cueball: Blast! Our evil plan is foiled!
What would actually happen:
[Cueball is holding a piece of paper and giving his friend a wrench.]
Cueball: His laptop's encrypted. Drug him and hit him with this $5 wrench until he tells us the password.
