[Megan and Black Hat are talking, Megan is sitting at a computer.]
Black Hat: I've discovered something.
Megan: Oh?
Black Hat: Standard server rack units and standard beehive honeycomb frames are compatible.
Black Hat: They're both 19 inches, with similar pitches.
Megan: Uh oh.
Black Hat: I'm pleased to announce that today, for a few hours, Google led the world in datacenter honey production.
Black Hat: Until their security people kicked me out.
Megan: I'm sorry your beekeeping career ended so quickly.
Black Hat: I'll find a new datacenter.
Black Hat: Turns out most colocation TOSes don't mention beehives.
Megan: I suspect that will soon change.
