[Ponytail walks up to Megan, who is sitting in an office chair at a desk using her laptop.]
Ponytail: When you make a big scientific discovery, it takes a while to get it published. 
Ponytail: Right?
Megan: Mm hmm.
[Zoom-in on Ponytail.]
Ponytail: So there are probably several research teams out there who are sitting on Nobel-Prize-worthy discoveries, but haven't told the rest of us yet.
Megan (off-panel): Makes sense.
[Ponytail leans over the desk, trying to see Megan's laptop screen from behind it.]
[Ponytail leans further. Megan pulls the screen down so Ponytail cannot see it.]
Ponytail: Sooo... What are you working on?
Megan: 
Ponytail: I promise I won't tell.
Megan: Shoo! Go bother someone else.
