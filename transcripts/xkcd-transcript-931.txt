There are 52 lanes, so 13 lanes per cancer stage. 

[The panels are arranged top to bottom. The first is set above a larger image.]
Friend: So, are you guys out of the woods?
Cueball: We don't know.
Friend: Well, did the treatment work?
Cueball: We don't know.
[Cueball's next few lines are set by themselves in their own panels, arranged around a larger image.]
Cueball: I always assumed that when you got cancer, they gave you a prognosis, then treated you, and at the end of treatment either you beat it or you died.
[The diagram shows a simple highway. Starting at the bottom, with diagnosis for five lanes, the road travels through a cloud of treatment, after which two lanes disappear, and three continue. Later on, there's another off-ramp labeled 'cancer "comes back"', which loops back into the treatment cloud. Otherwise, the highway enters a later cloud called survive.]
Cueball: And I knew sometimes it "recurred," which I assumed meant back to square one.
Cueball: But that's turned out not to be quite right.
[Back to Cueball and his friend.]
Cueball: Once most cancers spread out into your body, they're incurable.
Cueball: If your 10-year prognosis is 60%, that means a 40% chance that some cancer will slip past the treatment and get out.
[The frame zooms in to show just Cueball.]
Cueball: So they kill all the cancer they can find, and then you're a "survivor." But your odds are still 60%.
[The panel zooms in further, now showing only Cueball's top half.]
Cueball: They can't scan for individual cancer cells. The only way to know if it worked is to wait for tumors to pop up elsewhere.
Cueball: If you go enough years without that happening then you were in the 60%.
[The frame shows both people again.]
Cueball: And often the first sign is a cough or bone pain.
Cueball: So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry that every ache and pain is the answer to the question "Do I make it?"
[There's an extra large panel, with a small one floating inside it.]
[The panel shows fifty-two lanes emerging from the cloud of 'Treatment'. Signs show 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years. Lanes branch off and fade into darkness earlier on the right, with some lanes continuing off the top of the panel.]

Friend: Man.
Friend: Fuck cancer.
Cueball:
