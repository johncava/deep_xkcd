[Someone is sailing a lateen rigged sailboat.]
[The wind picks up, pushing the sail forward.]
[The wind builds strength, and the sailor has to stand up to hold on to the main sheet.]
[The sail balloons out, strangely distorted, and he can barely hold on to the sheet.]
[Finally, part of the sail separates into a bubble, and the sailor almost falls over backwards. The sail begins to return to its normal shape.]
[The sailor sits down and scratches his head in confusion as the bubble floats away.]
