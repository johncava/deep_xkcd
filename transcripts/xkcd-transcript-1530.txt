New chat message
[Below the chat log is shown with White Hat's comments on the left in gray frames and Cueball's comments to the right in white frames. The first post in a row from each person is labeled with their picture at the end of a small arrow in the frame]:

White Hat: Why do you always fixate on these bizarre details?
Cueball: I don't know.
Cueball: Sorry.
White Hat: It's weird, is all.

Cueball (chat): Yeah, of course. I know.
White Hat (speaking):
