[Cueball is on the phone with Ponytail, who's on her computer in the other half of a split panel.]
Cueball: Hello? ... Oh, hey. Looking for Megan? She's gaming.
Ponytail: I know. You know what's delicious? Nachos.
[Ponytail clicks on her computer while talking.]
Ponytail: When you layer the cheese so it gets on every chip... then smother them in sour cream and salsa...
Cueball: Mm, that IS delicious. And I've got the ingredients, too!
Ponytail, on phone: You should make some!
Cueball: I will!
Ponytail, on phone: Hurry.
[Cueball is making nachos in the microwave.]
Microwave: 
Megan, at her computer: My wifi signal!
[Ponytail who called is at her computer.]
Computer: Boom! Headshot.
