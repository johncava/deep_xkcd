[Cueball finds a computer tower with a wire leading away from it.]
Cueball: What's this?
Off-screen: The Cloud.
[Cueball looks behind him. The wire leads to an outlet in the wall next to where Black Hat sits at a desk with a computer. Another wire leads from that outlet to Black Hat's computer.]
Cueball: Huh? I always thought "The Cloud" was a huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere.
Black Hat: Yeah, but everyone buys server time from everyone else. In the end, they're all getting it here.
[A close-up of Black Hat.]
Cueball: How? You're on a cable modem.
Black Hat: There's a lot of caching.
[A close-up of Cueball, looking down at the tower at his feet.]
Cueball: Should the cord be stretched across the room like this?
Black Hat: Of course. It has to reach the server, and the server is over there.
[Cueball turns back to the Black Hat, still sitting at the computer.]
Cueball: What if someone trips on it?
Black Hat: Who would want to do that? It sounds unpleasant.
Cueball: Uh. Sometimes people do stuff by accident.
Black Hat: I don't think I know anybody like that.
