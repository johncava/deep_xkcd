[Megan and Cueball are talking.]
Megan: Did you see the neutrino speed of light thing?
Cueball: Yup! Good news; I need the cash.
Megan: Huh? Cash?
[Text above half-sized panel.]
Yeah. When there's a news story about a study overturning all of physics, I used to urge caution, remind people that experts aren't all stupid, and end up in pointless arguments about Galileo.
[Half-height panel.]
[Cueball sitting on chair, looking down at laptop in his lap. Books and things are on a desk in front of him.]
Cueball: No, this isn't  whether relativity exists. If it didn't, your GPS wouldn't work.
Cueball: What do you mean, "science thought police"? Have you seen our budget? We couldn't  to afford our own thought police.
[Megan and Cueball talking again.]
Megan: That sounds miserable and unfulfilling.
Cueball: Yup. So I gave up, and now I just find excited believers and bet them $200 each that the new result won't pan out.
[Same as last panel.]
Megan: That's mean.
Cueball: It provides a good income, and if I'm ever wrong, I'll be too excited about the new physics to notice the loss.
