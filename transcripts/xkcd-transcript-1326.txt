[Cueball is sitting on a throne, talking to a minion who's not shown in the panel.]
Minion: The prisoner escaped and is swimming toward the mainland!
Cueball: 
Minion: Yes, sir.
Minion: The sharks are swimming away.
Cueball: They're escaping, too? Send sharks after them!
Minion: Now  sharks are swimming away.
Cueball: 
Minion: ...Sir, what's going on?
Cueball: Prisoners, of course! Can't let 'em escape!
Minion: Sir, are you trying to turn Doom Island into a marine biology center?
Cueball: 
Cueball: *ahem*
Cueball: I mean, the world must fear us!
Minion: Right...
