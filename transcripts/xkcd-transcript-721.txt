[Cueball encounters a square on the ground.]
Cueball: Hey, A. Square. How's Flatland?
Square: Still flat. What's up?
Cueball: I just spent an hour playing a demo of this 4D game called Miegakure.
[A character in Miegakure jumps around the 4D landscape.]
Trying to jump from block to block in four dimensions hurt my brain.
Cueball: So I apologize for giving you a hard time when you were slow to understand 3D space. I sympathize now.
Square: It's okay.
Cueball: Also, I apologize for drawing arms, legs, and eyes on you to make you look like SpongeBob. That was out of line.
Square: Yes, it was.
