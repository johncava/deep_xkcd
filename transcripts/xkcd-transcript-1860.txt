[Egg-shaped character Humpty Dumpty, drawn with an angry face, is sitting on a brick wall and facing Alice.]
Humpty Dumpty: When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean. Neither more nor less.
Alice: I wonder what all those words you just said meant. Maybe you're telling me I can have all your stuff!
Humpty Dumpty: What!? No!
Alice: Your car, too? Gosh, thanks!
