Cueball: So how do we regulate all these micro drones?
Cueball: I mean, Amazon delivery bots sound cool...
[Cueball stands alone surrounded by three micro drones.]
Cueball: But I worry that overnight we'll realize we're surrounded by these things, no one will know who's controlling them, and then , sci-fi dystopia.
[Megan turns in her chair towards Cueball.]
Megan: If you wanna slow it down, why not just remove all regulations, but then make drone theft legal?
[Cueball takes his hand to his chin and Megan turns back to type on the laptop.]
Cueball: ...I  that.
Megan: You write to congress.
Megan: I'll stock up on butterfly nets.
