"There were no sounds of stirring save the click of a mouse."

'Twas the night before Christmas at my family's house.
There were no sound of stirring save the click of a mouse.
For 'twas just like a childhood Christmas except
I'd forgotten the hours that normal folks slept.
Santa: What are you doing out of bed so late?
Cueball: Late? It's barely 3AM!
