[Cueball and Megan are seated on a couch, watching TV.]
Megan: Argh, movie pet peeve- Someone sitting at a computer in the dark with the screen projected on their face. Monitors don't work like that!
[Cueball and Megan face each other on the couch.]
Cueball: Right - that only happens if you're in the way of a projected image. Like when we're sitting together in a parked car in the rain and the mottled light through the raindrops on the windshield makes shifting shadows on your skin...

[Megan stands up, Cueball uses a laptop on table behind the couch.]
Megan: ...I wasn't really into the movie anyway.
Cueball: The nearest rainstorm's about 60 miles away.
Megan: We'll drive fast.
Cueball: I'll grab some snacks.
