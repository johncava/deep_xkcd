[A person shows up at a boat docked at the edge of a river. The person has brought along a head of cabbage, a goat, and a wolf.]
Problem: The boat only holds two, but you can't leave the goat with the cabbage or the wolf with the goat.
[The wolf looks curiously at the cabbage that's been left behind while the person goes off with the goat.]
Solution: 1. Take the goat across.
[The goat remains tied up on the far side. The wolf watches the person come back.]
2. Return alone.
[The wolf sits and waits as the person goes off.]
3. Take the cabbage across. 
4. Leave the wolf. Why did you have a wolf?
[The wolf goes off.]
