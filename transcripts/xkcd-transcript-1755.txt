[Cueball and Hairbun are standing together and Cueball is talking to her.]
Cueball: What were things like in the old days?
Cueball: I hear that you had to ... compile things for different processors?
Hairbun: Yeah
[Same setting in a slimmer panel, now Hairbun is replying.]
Hairbun: To compile your code, you had to mail it to IBM.
Hairbun: It took 4-6 weeks.
[Close-up of Hairbun from the waist up.]
Hairbun: Before garbage collection, data would pile up until the computer got full and you had to throw it away.
[Same setting as in the first panel with Hairbun gesturing toward Cueball raising one hand  palm up.]
Hairbun: Early compilers could handle code fine, but comments had to be written in assembly.
[In a frame-less panel Hairbun is seen from the front, with both arms out to the side with both hands held palm up.]
Hairbun:  could only be written on punch cards.You had to pick a compact font, or you'd only fit a few characters per card.
[Exactly the same setting as the first panel, but with Hairbun doing the talking.]
Hairbun:  was big because it supported floppy disks.
Hairbun: It still punched holes in them, but it was a start.
Cueball: Wow.
