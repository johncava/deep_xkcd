[Cueball is on a corded wall phone.]
Cueball: Hello? 911? I'm trapped!
Cueball: It's dark and I can't see anything except these two distorted splotches of light!
Cueball: Help!
[Ponytail, a 911 operator is in an office, wearing a headset.]
Ponytail: Splotches of light? Your... eyeballs?
Cueball (over phone): I think that's what they are! There's meat everywhere!
[Focus on Ponytail's head.]
Ponytail: ...so you're a brain.
Cueball (over phone): Yes!
Ponytail: Yeah, we all are. You're not trapped. Use your body to walk around and experience reality.
Cueball: But everything's just signals in my sensory cortices! How can I be sure they correspond to an external world?!
Ponytail (over phone): I'm sorry, but we can't send a search-and-rescue team into Plato's cave.
