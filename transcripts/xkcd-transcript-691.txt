[Cueball and a friend approach a table.]
Cueball: Hey, what's up?
Friend: Shhhhh.
Cueball: Hrm?
Friend: There's a microSD card on your table.
[A microSD card sits next to an assortment of coins for size reference.]
Cueball (out of panel): So?
Friend (out of panel): I dunno, high storage densities freak me out. A whole aisle of library shelves on something smaller than a dime.
[The two people stand near the table, the friend peering at the coins and card on the table.]
Friend: Libraries are unnerving enough-millions of ideas surrounding you, towering over you. These cards fill me with that same reverence, that same intimidation.
[Cueball stands alone.]
Friend (out of panel): ...that same faint arousal. Maybe I'll just touch it.
Cueball: If you lose that card I'm  helping you find it.
