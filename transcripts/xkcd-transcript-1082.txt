The division of usually sedimentary rocks into distinct layers.
A process in which two geological regions are moving apart, and potentially allowing for magma to rise up between them. Spreading occurs in mid-ocean ridges and in rift valleys. 
 Breccia is a rock made of broken fragments of other rocks. When these fragments can be formed from the rubbing between rocks in a fault, it is a friction breccia.
The crystals in a rock can be aligned by the plastic flow of a rock when it is hot. This causes the rock to split (cleave) along particular planes.
A result of spreading is that rocks break, forming vertical faults, and allowing regions to sink and form valleys.
A period of mountain forming.
 a sloping crack in the rocks at which one region of rocks is pushing another up.
A type of rock made up of different bands.
An isolated hill with steep sides and a flat top, but smaller than a plateau.
[Two people are doing a geological survey.]
Megan: Forget the bedding - we were wrong about the whole valley.
Cueball: The spreading is recent.
Megan: See the friction breccia?
Cueball: Oh - flow cleavage!
Cueball: Deeper in the rift.
Megan: Deeper.

[They both drop to the ground in a fit of passion.]
Geology: Surprisingly erotic.
