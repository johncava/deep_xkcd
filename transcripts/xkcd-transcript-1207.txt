Cueball: What's that?
Black Hat: It's a drone for my new business, .
Black Hat (narrating): Our UAVs follow you and learn your schedule. If you miss a turn, forget an appointment, or give someone inaccurate information, they alert you.
Megan (on phone): I'll be there in five.
Booming voice from the sky: 
Megan: Augh!
Cueball: That sounds annoying. Who would  for that?
Black Hat: Huh? Nobody pays. I'm just making these and releasing them.
Cueball: That's not a business. You're just yelling at strangers from the sky.
Cueball: A business has to make money somehow.
Booming voice from the sky: 
Cueball: Augh!!
