Mildly sleazy uses of Facebook, part 14:
Looking up someone's profile before introducing yourself so you know which of your favorite bands to mention
Cueball: Favorite bands? Hmm...
Cueball: Maybe Regina Spektor or the Polyphonic Spree.
Megan: Whoa, those are two of my favorites, too!
Megan: Clearly, we should have sex.
Cueball: Okay! My favorite position is the retrograde wheelbarrow.
[Megan raises arms.]
Megan: Ohmygod, mine too!
