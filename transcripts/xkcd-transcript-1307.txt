On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me.
12 Drummers drumming
11 Pipers piping
10 Lords a-leaping
9 Ladies dancing
8 Maids a-milking
7 Swans a-swimming
6 Geese a-laying
5 Golden rings
4 Calling birds
3 French hens
2 Turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree.
[Four carolers (Megan, Cueball, Ponytail and Hairy) are singing.]
12 Best drummers of 
11 Pipers whose jaw-dropping good piping will make you cry
You won't  what these 10 lords leap over

Carolers outside the Buzzfeed offices perform "12 Weird things I  for Christmas"
