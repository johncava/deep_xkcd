Of course, Jupiter is not only planet-sized, but is  compared to Earth; in fact, Earth would fit quite comfortably into the  of Jupiter.
Gravitational slingshots are used by deep-space probes to gain speed by approaching a planet and then leaving that planet; the gravity fields of the sun and the planet changes the trajectory of the probe, and the end result is an extremely fuel-efficient way of gaining speed during space travel. Jupiter is commonly used for this purpose because it's the most massive planet in our solar system.
Needless to say, reintroducing wolves to a server room is neither a good idea nor OSHA-approved.
Cueball may also be referencing a computer program named "reintroduction" or something similar when he says "We started a reintroduction program"
The title-text refers to the wolves thinning the RAID array. A  is a way of spreading data redundantly across multiple hard drives, such that 100% of the data is still recoverable if some number of drives go down. This number can be set arbitrarily, as long as you have at least one more disk than the number you want, but it reduces your total storage space accordingly. The seek speed of a drive is how fast it can find a specific point of data on its platter; thus, the wolves are essentially killing the slowest drives, implementing a kind of natural selection to "evolve" the drives to be faster.
The caption implies that even Randall is not sure what meaning this comic has.
However, as he has made a mash up of Mozart, Bach and Wagner - this must be intentional - so  does not attribute the Magic Flute to Bach! 
Here it starts taking a turn for the worse. If wearing one of  shirts means she spent the night with , logically, wearing one of your  shirts means she spent the night with . This earns a "Wat!" reaction.
Finally, human skin is not generally designed to detach from its owner. If the girl from your bio class is wearing your mom's skin like a suit, it means she probably murdered your mom and skinned her. This is a reference to serial killer , who (among other things) made suits out of the skin of some of his victims. To this, Cueball can only scream.
[Cueball and Megan stand facing each other.]
Cueball: Jupiter will make its closest approach to Earth in decades.
[Cueball points behind Megan, and she turns around.]
Cueball: In fact, here it comes now!
[Jupiter, about the size of the characters' heads, hovers into the frame at about head-height.]
Jupiter: Hey, guys.
[Jupiter continues to hover through the frame as the characters watch it go.]
Jupiter: Anyone need a gravitational slingshot?
Megan: No, I'm good.
Jupiter: Aight.
[Cueball sits on a box, playing a guitar.]
Cueball: ...Now I don't blame him 'cause he ran and hid,
Cueball: but the meanest thing that he ever did
Cueball: was before he left, he went and named me "Trig."
[Cueball looks down a well.]
Cueball: Oh God, a little girl is trapped down this well!
[Cueball runs off screen.]
[Cueball returns, leading a pony.]
Cueball: It's okay, we got you that pony you always wanted!
[Cueball tries to cram the pony down the well with the aid of a large stick.]
Cueball: Get... in... there...
Cueball: Ugh!
[Cueball and Megan stand in a server room. ]
Cueball: I like to get back to nature by coming out here to the server room.
Cueball: The warmth, the whirr of the drives, the drone of the fans, the howl of the wolves...
Megan: Wolves?
Cueball: Yeah, we started a reintroduction program.
Wolf: Awoooooo
[Cueball stands by himself in the frame.]
Cueball: Yo momma's so masculine that she... oh, wait, that's your dad.
Cueball: Is your mom the lady over by the door? Aww, she looks nice!
[Cueball runs toward another man who is wearing a powdered wig, holding a gun in one hand, and a flute in the other. Behind him, someone is chasing him on a motorcycle.]
Cueball: Bach, activate the magic flute and teleport us home! Wagner's right behind me on his Ring Cycle!
Why did I  this?
