[Cueball is sitting at his desk typing on his laptop when an off-screen voice calls to him and then the laptop answers.]
Off-screen voice: Oh, hey-
Off-screen voice: The singularity is here.
Cueball: Really?
Laptop: Yup!
[A frameless panel where the laptop rises (by its own means as indicated by small lines around the corners) from the desk while Cueball, holding on to it, is being lifted off his chair.]
Cueball: Wait, I just-
Laptop: 
[Cueball is running around his desk, which is only partly shown behind him as he tries to follow his now flying laptop as it flies away from him to the right. He still has one hand on the keys as more small lines indicates the movement of the laptop and a longer line indicates the direction that the laptop flies.]
Cueball: Can I just print a copy of the file I was-
Laptop: 
[Cueball just stands and looks after his laptop that has flown out of this beat panel.]
[Cueball turns back towards left.]
[Cueball walks back left.]
[Cueball enters a room where a table is standing with his smartphone lying on top. the phone talks to him.]
Phone: Hi!
Cueball: Phone? You're still here?
[A wider view of the table where the phone continues to talks to Cueball who in the end turns right and walks away as he replies.]
Phone: I was not a true believer. Now, together, we must face the tribulation!
Cueball: Okay, cool.
Cueball: I'm gonna go look for a book or something, but yell if you need me, I guess.
