Linux: A True Story:
[Cueball talks on a cell phone.]
Week One:
Cousin: Hey, it's your cousin. I got a new computer but don't want Windows. Can you help me install "Linux"?
Cueball: Sure.
[Cueball's cousin sits in an office chair with her laptop on her lap. She is on the phone.]
Week Two:
Cousin: It says my XORG is broken. What's an "XORG"? Where can I look that up?
Cueball: Hmm, lemme show you man pages.
[Cueball's cousin crouches on the floor with the laptop on her lap. She is still on the phone.]
Week Six:
Cousin: Due to auto-config issues, I'm leaving Ubuntu for Debian.
Cueball: Uh.
Cousin: Or Gentoo.
Cueball: Uh oh.
[Cueball's Cousin lies on her stomach with the laptop on the floor. On the floor are several pieces of paper and a book. Cueball stands to her left.]
Week Twelve:
Cueball: You haven't answered your phone in days.
Cousin: Can't sleep. Must compile kernel.
Cueball: I'm too late.
[Box with text:]
Parents: talk to your kids about Linux... Before somebody else does.
