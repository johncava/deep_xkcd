[A Cueball-like guy is standing behind, a sports car where Cueball sits turned toward him.]
Friend: When'd you get the car?
[Zoom-in on Cueball in the car.]
Cueball: It's the darndest thing. We bought it as a prize for the 100,000,000 visitor to our website.
[Zoom-in on the friend.]
Friend: And they didn't want it?
Cueball (off-screen): Apparently.
[Pan to where both the friend and Cueball in the car can be seen, but not the front of the car.]
Friend: Maybe they didn't see the notice.
Cueball: It was flashing and everything!
Friend: How bizarre.
