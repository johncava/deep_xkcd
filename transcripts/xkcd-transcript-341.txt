[Cueball talks to his Cueball-like friend who is lying down on the floor, using his laptop. Cueball is pointing at the laptop.]
Cueball: You're not on the neighbor's WiFi, are you?
Friend: Yeah, why?
Cueball: The admin... plays games.
Friend: No problem. I'll just hop on a secure VPN.
[Cueballs friend now sits on his knee in front of his laptop frantically typing. A message from the laptop comes out with a zig zag line]
Friend: Whoa, my connections are dying as soon as I start to tunnel anything!
Message on laptop: A VPN? How cute! And stop trying to SSH.
Friend: Holy shit! Someone's inserting notes into the pages I request! Editing the TCP stream live!
Friend: Nobody's that fast. Who  this admin?
[In a frame-less panel Mrs. Roberts with hot bun tray in one hand (indicated with five wiggly lines above the buns), with oven mitts on both hands typing on her desktop computer on a table.]
Mrs. Roberts: My goodness. Neighborhood scamps on the wireless.

[Cueball is standing with a hand towards his now standing friend, the laptop lies between them.]
Cueball: I should have warned you about Mrs. Roberts.
Friend: How does she type with oven mitts!?
Cueball: You've been pwned pretty hard, man. You might want to sit down.
