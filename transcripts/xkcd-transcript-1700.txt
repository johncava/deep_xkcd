[Cueball sits at his desk in front of his computer leaning back and turning away from it to speak to a person off-panel.]
Cueball: Can you take a look at the bug I just opened?
Off-panel voice: Uh oh.
[Zoom out and pan to show only Cueball sitting on his chair facing away from the computer, which is now off-panel. The person speaking to him is still of panel even though this panel is much broader.]
Off-panel voice: Is this a  bug, or one of those horrifying ones that prove your whole project is broken beyond repair and should be burned to the ground?
[Zoom in on Cueball's head and upper torso.]
Cueball: It's a normal one this time, I promise.
Off-panel voice: OK, what's the bug?
[Back to a view similar to the first panel where Cueball has turned towards the computer and points at the screen with one hand.]
Cueball: The server crashes if a user's password is a resolvable URL.
Off-panel voice: I'll get the lighter fluid.
