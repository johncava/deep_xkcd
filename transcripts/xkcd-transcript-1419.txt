Megan: Why is there a teapot in the bathroom?
Off-panel voice (right): Sorry. When I'm on the phone I always zone out and pick stuff up and carry it around.
Megan: There's a hammer in the fridge.
Off-panel voice: Another phone call. I was just fidgeting.
Megan: Did you put all our stuff in weird stacks?
Off-panel voice: Long call. Sorry.
Megan: ...Why is there a giant obelisk in the backyard?
Off-panel voice: Phone again. My bad.
Megan: It's carved with prayers to "Ba'al, the Soul-Eater."
Off-panel voice: Haha! I'm so absentminded.
