[This was a dynamic image where the text changed during April 1st. The main title text also changed after the dynamic part was finished, and there are even different title text for different part of the comic. This transcript is of the final version of the comic, (no longer dynamic or changing), as displayed at present on xkcd, there are still four different title texts for specific panels. These four title text are for that reason included here in the transcript.]
[The basic title text for the entire comic is: "This comic went up on April 1st, and the panels changed throughout the day in response to readers doing things like breaking hashes, edited a rapidly-shuffling set of target Wikipedia articles, and donating to Wikimedia Foundation. (The vandalism is over now and CMU won the hashing contest.)" The other three title text are only active over certain panels.] 
[The first panel with the caption and Megan below has it's own title text. A part of that panel is a link, and in the section where this link is active there is no title text at all. The title text for the rest of the first panel is: "Happy April 1st, everyone!"]
[A panel with only text is above the first drawing. There is a link on the top part of the text to http://almamater.xkcd.com/ (the link is now broken).]
Ahoy, carnegie melonites! 

Come find your future at Baidu.

[Ponytail sits at a desk, hand to her chin, with two Cueball-like guys with their hands on the table.]
Ponytail: Let's block Canada
Cueball-like guys: Sounds good.
[Ponytail crouches on a moving Roomba (labeled) with a steaming mug of coffee in one hand and a smartphone in the other. Above her is a caption. The Roomba makes a noice]
We're a convenient four hour drive from New York City (15,000 hours by Roomba.)

Roomba
[Ponytail and Hairy corners Cueball as he walks out of a door, and a black haired ponytailed girl is moving towards him wielding a giant butterfly net. There is a caption above them:]
Our recruiters are on the hunt for unaware CMU graduates
[The fifth panel has it's own title text only active within (or very close to) the frame. It is: "uic has the third best hash. See the full standings at http://almamater.xkcd.com/best.csv" (The link is now broken)]
[There is a caption above a website application. There is three fields to be filled, with each their caption and text:]

Off-screen voice: Experimental dog generator. Don't click on it; the default size isn't set, so-

[The last three panels has their own title text, only active within a frame that could contain all three panel. Outside that "frame" (all the way around) is the other title text. Within the title text is: "The dog gains a pound for every $10 donated to the Wikimedia Foundation via this link. Currently at $51135.33."]
[Small insert panel, going in above the next larger panel: Cueball stares at the screen.]
 

Off-screen voice: Uh oh.
[A giant dog looks down at the desk where the computer once was, now only the wires are left. Cueball, leaning way back in his office chair, holding his hand to his mouth, stares up at it.]
[Again a smaller insert panel above the large one with the dog. A graphic showing two sliders and a dog (similar to the one in the previous panel). Next to the dog with arrows pointing to it are a thermometer graphic and an equation. Below is an e-mail type text and finally a caption. There are arrows over and under "God" and "dogs" between the g and d's.]
