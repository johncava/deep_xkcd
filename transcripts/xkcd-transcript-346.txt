[Cueball and his friend are sitting on the ground, with a bottle of Diet Coke between them, and Cueball appears to be putting mentos into the bottle.]
Cueball: This is the coolest thing. You just drop the mentos in the Diet Coke...
Friend: Uh huh.
[Diet Coke starts to fizzle.]
Cueball: Give it a moment...
[Someone teleports into frame in a magic puff. Cueball's arms are raised, with a package of mentos in one hand]

Friend: D-Dad?
Dad: I'm back, son. We can be a family again.
