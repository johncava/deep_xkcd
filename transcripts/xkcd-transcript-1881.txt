[Black Hat stands in front of a store counter facing White Hat who stands behind.]
Black Hat: My drone keeps flying into the wrong rooms. Do you have anything to discourage it? 
White Hat: Sir, this is a pet store. 
Black Hat: Yeah, I was thinking one of those spray bottles for cats. 
White Hat: I don't think you can train a drone. 
[White Hat hands a spray bottle over the counter.]
Black Hat: Eh, they say that about cats, too. Plus, these days they probably all come with deep learning or whatever. Drones, I mean. Maybe cats too. 
White Hat: Fine, here's a bottle. 
Black Hat: Do you sell a shock collar that can fit around a Roomba? 
White Hat: I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
