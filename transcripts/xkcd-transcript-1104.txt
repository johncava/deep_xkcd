[Megan is walking up to Science Girl with a bow in her hair bun. Science Girl has a stack of three books in front of her, is reading another book and a fifth book lies behind her on the floor.]
Megan: What are you reading about?
Science Girl: Dinosaurs!
Megan: Oh, yeah.
[Zoom out of the same scene, with Megan standing and Science Girl looking up at her.]
Megan: They've gotten all weird since when I was a kid.
Megan: They used to be awesome, but now they all have dorky feathers, right?
Science Girl: Yup!
[Same scene in a frame-less panel. Science Girl looks down and below the two characters there is a footnote.]
Science Girl: This says they now think raptors used their wings for stability, flapping to stay on top of their prey while hanging on with their hooked claws and eating it alive.

[Zoom in on the same scene, the book on the floor is outside the panel. Megan just stands staring at Science Girl who reads on. Beat panel.]
[Megan is now on the floor next to Science Girl flipping through the top book she has taken from the pile.]
