US Space Team's Up Goer Five
The only flying space car that's taken anyone to another world (explained using only the ten hundred words people use the most often)
[A list of Saturn-V parts, top to bottom, with their "Up Goer" description follows.]
[Launch Escape System (LES)]: Thing to help people escape really fast if there's a problem and everything is on fire so they decide not to go to space

[Apollo spacecraft.]

[Instrument Unit]: Ring holding most of the computers
[S-IVB third stage]: Part that falls off third (this part flew away from our world into space and hit the world we were going toward)

[S-II second stage]: Part that falls off second

[S-IC first stage]: Part that falls off first

[Bottom of spacecraft]: This end should point toward the ground if you want to go to space. If it starts pointing toward space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today.
