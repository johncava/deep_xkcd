[A support window is shown.]
An old Windows utility has an undocumented feature. If you open "help" and click on the background, you get dropped into a "support" chat room.
Support Window: Launching support forum...
[An active conversation between two people is shown.]
Only a few of us ever found it. But we became friends.
[Cueball and Ponytail are at computers.]
We kept launching the program to check in. Eventually some of us were running VMs just to keep accessing it.
[Another conversation.]
As the Internet aged, so did we.
[Three question marks.]
We don't know who runs the server. We don't know why it's still working so many years later. Maybe we're some sysadmin's soap opera.
[A group of people are shown in a bubble.]
It will probably vanish someday, but for now it's our meeting place. Our hideaway.
[The bubble is now smaller, and some parts of a web are shown.]
A life's worth of chat,
[More of the web is shown.]
Buried in the deep web.
[A flat landscape is shown with the sun at the horizon.]
But even if it lasts forever,  won't. When we're gone, who will remember us?
[Cueball and Hairy are shown standing together in a bubble.]
Who will remember this strange little world and the friendships we built here?
Nobody.
[An empty bubble is shown.]
This place is irrelevant. Ephemeral. One day it will be forgotten.
[The bubble starts to fade away.]
And so will we
[The bubble has almost completely faded away.]
[The bubble is now completely gone.]
But at least it doesn't have fucking video ads.
