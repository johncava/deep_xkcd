My Hobby:
Renting an SUV and confusing the hell out of hybrid owners
[A Prius Driver is pumping gas into his car at a gas station. The prices can be seen in the background, and read:]
$4.08
M: $4.38
P: $4.51
D: $4.85
[Cueball drives up alongside in an SUV and leans out the window.]
Cueball: Check out those prices! Your Prius ain't looking so smart , huh?
Prius Driver: It's ... wait, what?
Cueball: Maybe you'll go green  time, asshole!
