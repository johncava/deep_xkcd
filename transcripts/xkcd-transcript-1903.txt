[Beret Guy holds a stick and points at a board next to him. The board contains a picture of a rabbit, a data point graph and other notes.]
Beret Guy: Good morning, Governor. Our tracking systems show a rapid increase in the number of buns around the Capitol.
[Hairy is sitting at an office desk and facing Beret Guy in a frameless panel.]
Hairy: Buns?
Beret Guy: Yes; there's been a long-term upward trend, but it has accelerated recently.
Hairy: The trend in... rabbits.
Beret Guy: Yes.
[Beret Guy takes out his phone.]
Hairy: So... so what?
Beret Guy: So if you want to see some buns, there are lots of them outside!
[Beret Guy's phone vibrates]
Phone: 
Beret Guy: Ooh!
Beret Guy: There's a small one right now!
[Zoom-in on Beret Guy.]
Hairy (offscreen): Do you... actually  for me?
Beret Guy: Almost certainly. We had an election, right? I wrote my name in on the thing.
Hairy (offscreen): Security?
Beret Guy: It's been an honor to serve.
