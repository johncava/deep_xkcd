Once upon a midnight dreary
While I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore
While i nodded, nearly napping,
Suddenly there came a tapping
As if someone gently rapping
Rapping at my chamber door...
[A door opens, revealing Eminem wearing a hoodie.]


Eminem: Yo.
