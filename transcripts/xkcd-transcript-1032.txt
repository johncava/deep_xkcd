[A man approaches Beret Guy at a party and they extend arms to shake hands. Beret Guy is holding a metal briefcase. Ponytail is a waitress in the background, carrying a tray with a wine glass on it.]
Connr: I'm Connr Clark, CTO at Eusocial Media Ventures.
Beret Guy: I'm a business professional! Earlier I photocopied a burrito!
[Connr hands Beret Guy a business card. Beret Guy takes it and hands Connr another business card. Beret Guy has put his suitcase on the floor.]
Connr: You should check us out! Here's my card.
Beret Guy: Here's mine! Networking!
[Connr takes a closer look at the card, and Beret Guy holds up his case.]
Connr: ...this just says "This is my business card!"
Beret Guy: Do you like it? I have more in my handlebox.
[Beret Guy puts his case on a table and opens it to reveal it is full of cash. Connr looks on in shock.]
