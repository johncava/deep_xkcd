[An image of a violet that is colored red.]
Megan (off-screen):
Violets are red
[An image of a rose that is colored blue.]
Megan (off-screen):

[Megan and Cueball are standing around a table, on which a screen is in front of the rose and violet. Megan is in front of a lectern with a mic. All of this is on a stage.]
Megan:

[Same scene, but Megan moves the screen away from in front of the rose and violet. It is revealed that the flowers' actual colors are those from the original poem, i.e. the violet is blue and the rose is red.]
Megan:
Alter their hue.
