[Megan and Cueball converse.]
Megan: What kind of music do you listen to?
Cueball: Oh, a mix of things. Some classic rock like Boston, but then of course Queen and Bowie, Joan Jett...
Megan: Definitely, we need more of those sounds.
Cueball: But there's some great newer stuff too, like Franz Ferdinand, The Donnas, and Audioslave.
Megan: Sometimes they're a little much for me. I go more for things like The Arcade Fire, sometimes mixing some electronic sounds like Postal Service.
