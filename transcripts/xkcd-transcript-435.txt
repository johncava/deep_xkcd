Sociologists
Psychologists
Biologists
Chemists
Physicists
Mathematicians
[Above each of the six tick there is a person. The last person to the right is the mathematician, she stands at the far right edge of the comic, with much further distance between her and the second last person going right. The first four spaces between the first five persons are of equal distance. Except for the least pure sociologist they all say something addressed to the less pure person(s) on their left. The first mute person above the Sociologists tick is Megan. The second person above the Psychologists tick is a bald man with glasses and goatee beard holding a book under one arm. The third person above the Biologists tick is a Cueball-like guy with a squirming octopus in his hand. The fourth person above the Chemists tick is Ponytail holding up a test tube with bubbles coming out of the top. The fifth person above the Physicists tick is Cueball standing with his hands in his sides. Farthest out the final and sixth person above the Mathematicians tick is Blondie. She waves to the other five.]
Psychologist: Sociology is just applied psychology.
Biologist: Psychology is just applied biology.
Chemist: Biology is just applied chemistry
Physicist: Which is just applied physics. It's nice to be on top.
Mathematician: Oh, hey, I didn't see you guys all the way over there.
