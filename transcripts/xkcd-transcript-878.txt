[Cueball to the left and his friend, who also looks like Cueball, are standing in the friend's rather large basement, where the celling is held up by six thin columns, and the walls are shown angling in towards a point of perspective, to display how big the room is.]
Friend: I want to build a perfect HO-scale (~1/87) model train layout of my town.
Cueball: In your basement? Bad idea. Never make a layout of the area you're in.
[Zoom in on the two friends without the basement visualized.]
Friend: Why not?
Cueball: Because it'd include a little 10" replica of your house.
[Zoom in Cueball's friend who takes his hand to his chin.]
