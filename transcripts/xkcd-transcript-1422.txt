Beret Guy: My phone's about to die.
Cueball: Where'd you get a big iPhone? I didn't think they were out yet.
Beret Guy: It's my regular one. It's just dying.
Beret Guy: As it consumes its battery, it heats up and expands. Soon it will swell to enormous size, engulfing us both.
Beret Guy: Then it will collapse in a violent explosion!
Cueball: ...do you want to borrow my charger?
Beret Guy: That would only make it run out !
