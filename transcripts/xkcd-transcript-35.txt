Another from my high-school notebooks.
[A sheep and a green saguaro cactus in a brown pot is linked by an arcing yellow electricity bolt.]
I had a little cactus and I treasured it with pride,
admiring its spines and dainty flowers.
Until the day - oh tragic day! - when it was RAMIFIED,
by a ram with strange psychokinetic powers.
Baaing deep, this shaman sheep came whiffling through the brambles.
It gazed upon my cactus and, with yellow flash and thudrous crash,
with dashing, brash, and rash panache,
it blew the plant to shambles.
I was, I confess, horrified - I sat and cried my eyes out!
Oh stupid sheep, satanic sheep, so wrong and rash and willful!
I nursed the cactus best I could, till finally it came about.
It grows apace now, once again, but all it blooms is steel wool!
Oh God I need sleep!
Mary had a little lamp
She tied it to a pylon
Ten thousand volt went up its a**
And turned its wool to nylon.
