[Cueball and Megan sit at an intimate dinner table. They have plates and glasses of wine in front of them.]
Cueball: So, did you grow up around here?
Megan: I love you.
Cueball: ... huh?
Megan: Waiter! One of everything on the menu.
[Megan stands up. Standing on her chair, she's holding a plate.]
Cueball: Why are you up there?
Megan: I'm stuck.
Megan: This plate looks delicious.
Megan: Aaaoogaoag.
[Megan has put the plate down and walked off-panel.]
Megan: Bye.
Megan: OK. Coming back now.
[Megan is crouched on her chair, holding a spiral.]
Cueball: You're being controlled by Twitch, aren't you?
Megan: Check out this cool spiral!
