[A van (almost exiting the frame to the right) and a pickup truck behind the van are driving on a road where dust blows up behind the tires. There are three mountain peaks in the background. In the rear of the truck is a cylindrical shaped object. Above the truck there are two frames with yellow background and text. The top frame is at the hight of the mountains, the other just above the truck.]
1,000 miles north of tornado alley
A new breed of scientists has emerged.
[At the base of a mountain (or glacier front) to the right, Cueball runs towards Ponytail (as shown with a curling line behind his raised leg). He is carrying a laptop in his arms and he has a headset with antenna and microphone on. Ponytail is holding a probe in both hands, maybe drilling it into the ground. Grass and small rocks are drawn around them. At the top is another frame with yellow background and text.]
Half researchers, half adrenaline junkies
Ponytail: What's the reading?
Cueball: 3.9 meters down, gradient's off the charts!
[The pickup truck is shown in a zoom in from the side. Cueball is driving very fast, while holding a Walkie-talkie up to his head. The cylinder in the rear, from the first frame, now clearly turns out to be some kind of instrument with a small parabolic disc and a smaller antenna and there are some labels and a text is written across it, although it is difficult to read. At the top is another frame with yellow background and text.]
Risking everything for the thrill of the hunt
Cueball: The freeze line is shifting! We've never seen anything like it!
Cylinder: Riwan
[Ponytail is holding a large video camera down towards a tiny spot of grass on the ground. She is standing in a barren field with one small mountain to the left and three small mountain peaks to the right in background. Behind her is a large box connected to a small radio with a long antenna. Cueball speaks to her over his walkie-talkie, his voice coming from the radio via a zigzag line. At the top is a final frame with yellow background and text.]
Permafrost chasers
Ponytail: I'm getting some great footage here!
Cueball: Dammit, Harding, it's not worth your neck! Get the hell out of there!
