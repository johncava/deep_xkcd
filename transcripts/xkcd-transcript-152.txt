[Cueball stands by a genie, whose lower body becomes smoke and trails down to an old-fashioned lamp.]
Genie: You have awakened me from the lamp. You may have three wishes. What does your heart desire?
Cueball: I'd like a human-sized hamster ball.
[A hamster ball appears; Cueball is inside it, arms outstretched.]
Cueball: Sweet!
[Cueball steps to left; the ball rolls that way.]
[He does the same thing to his right.]
[Cueball comes to rest in the centre of the panel.]
Genie: And your other wishes?
Cueball: Why would I need other wishes?
