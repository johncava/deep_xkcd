The stamps in the background form the  of the chemical elements. And since  is not physics, according to the quote,  must be stamp collectors (as, the high on methylacetate,  wearing goggles and holding an ).
 These lines, both sung by Cueball, refer to subjects where a majority of graduates will end up unemployed or eventually working in a field outside their majors. Topics such as  or
