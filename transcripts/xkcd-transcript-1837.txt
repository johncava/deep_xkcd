[A Cueball-like guy standing behind a desk looking at a computer screen services Megan and Cueball on the other side of the desk.]
Guy: We have two rental cars left.
Guy: One is the murder car. But don't let the name scare you!
Guy: It's definitely haunted. But most drivers don't get murdered.
Guy: Maybe one in six.
[The guy lifts his hand and looks at Megan and Cueball.]
Guy: The other is a regular sedan.
