The German physicist  invented the , or CRT, in 1897. The Russian scientist  was the first to use the CRT to receive a video signal. CRT was the most common technology used for television screens and computer monitors in the last century, but has since been succeeded by modern devices such as , , or the ubiquitous . In the demo, Douglas used CRT monitors to demonstrate video conferencing, as well as collaborative real-time editing.
Douglas did refer to this device as a "mouse", but officially it was named the "X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System". He filed a  for this device on June 21, 1967 and received the patent on November 17, 1970. Douglas stated: "I don't know why we call it a mouse. It started that way and we never changed it."
This is well known today as "cut, copy and paste". On some early text-based systems, the user moved the cursor to the beginning of the text to be copied, typed <CTRL>+K+B , and then moved the cursor to the end of the copied text and typed <CTRL>+K+E. At the demo, Douglas demonstrated that the same task could be accomplished with the mouse. Today, many people do not use keyboard commands for cut, copy and paste, and instead use the mouse exclusively.
Text editors were in the nascent stage of their development in 1968. Douglas demonstrated the first text editor capable of "joint file editing". The first successful system to implement joint file editing came 15 years later, when  was made available in the middle of the 1980's.
Although not referred to as e-mail, Douglas demonstrated the exchange of "direct messages", which fulfills a similar role to modern e-mail.
The demo also demonstrated the exchange of files between users, paving the way for modern file sharing, and the associated legal and ethical debate.
Douglas demonstrated a "masking codec" capable of coding and decoding an audio stream. This would eventually lead to the development of the wide variety of modern audio codecs, including the MP3 codec, which was produced by the .
This song was first released by  in 1984, sixteen years after Douglas's demo.
A form of image with large text, typically in the font "Impact", superimposed over a photograph, typically for humorous effect.
The most famous of the image macros, featuring cats.
As the fictional Douglas states, this is an acronym for "you only live once". It has been around for at least a century, but in 2011 it saw a huge boost in popularity in both youth culture and internet memes mocking youth culture.
San Francisco, December 9th, 1968:
[We see a figure talking into a headset. It's a fair assumption that it's Douglas Engelbart.]
Douglas: ...We generated video signals with a cathode ray tube... We have a pointing device we call a "mouse"... I can "copy" text... ... and we have powerful join file editing... underneath the file here we can exchange "direct messages"...
[Douglas continues to narrate. Some music is playing.]
Douglas: ...Users can share files... ... files which can encode audio samples, using our "masking codecs"... The file you're hearing now is one of my own compositions...
Music: I heard there was a secret chord
[Douglas continues to narrate.]
Douglas: ...And you can superimpose text on the picture of the cat, like so... This cat is saying "YOLO", which stands for "You Only Live Once"... ...Just a little acronym we thought up...
