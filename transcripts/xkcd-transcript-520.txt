[A scientist (looking like Cueball) is pointing into an aquarium tank with two small animals floating in the water. He explains that they are cuttlefish to Cueball and Megan who are on the other side of the tank looking into it, Cueball with a hand to his mouth. Above them there is a frame inside the panel with a caption:]
We visit a bio lab: 
Scientist: These are cuttlefish.
[Very detailed drawing of a cuttlefish, with it's special W shaped pupils, all eight arms and two longer tentacles, and the striped body with waving parts shown waving down each side. The scientist tells about the animal with text above and below.]
Scientist (off-panel): They're frighteningly smart, have manipulating arms and tentacles, have ink jets, can dart backwards and see the polarization of light through their w-shaped pupils. 
Scientist (off-panel): And their sides are 200 dpi display screens which they use for camouflage and communication.
[Back to the original setting where the scientist stand a little further back from the tank with his arms down. Cueball and Megan has also moved further back and are even leaning away from the tank]
Scientist: When we realized how intelligent they were, we began to teach them. 
Scientist: They've advanced quickly. 
Scientist: 
[The two cuttlefish float straight out of the tank (lines indicating they movement water splashing at the surface of the tank). The scientist looks down at them, while Cueball and Megan holding hands and leans further back and Cueball takes his hand back to his mouth.]
[Pan to only the scientist, standing with one arm bend in front of him and the other holding a finger up to his mouth, and the tank from where the cuttlefish now flies towards Cueball and Megan who are now off-panel. Lines behind the cuttlefish shows they fly right but bobbing up and down. The cuttlefish talks in a strange way where the letters are alternately up and down.]
Cuttlefish: KL TE PYIIT
Cuttlefish: KL TE PYIIT
[Pan to Megan and Cueball, with the tank almost inside the left frame. Both cuttlefish is surrounded by their own zigzag line, which then extends from them in a thin line to encompass either Cueball or Megan. Cueball was running away from them, when this happens, legs bend at the knees and arms out and one bend. Megan has fallen lying face down arms out.]
[In this panel with faint gray shading Cueball is waking up in bed from the dream rising up to sitting position suddenly as indicated with two movement lines behind his head. One arm is supporting him on the bed next to the pillow, and the other is pulling his sheet down away from his torso. The first sentence is maybe still part of the dream as there is no line from Cueball to the sentence, and it is written high up. There is a line to the second sentence.]
Cueball: Oh god. 
Cueball: I knew it.
[This panel is divided into five segments. At the top there is a large caption in two lines. The there are three drawings following each other from left to right. First a bottle is pouring liquid into a an Erlenmeyer flask (a conical laboratory flask) which is half full. Then Cueball takes the flask and holds it up as a salute. Finally he drinks from it leaning his head way back. Below there is more text.]
