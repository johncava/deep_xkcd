[Cueball is shown texting on a phone with a friend. Above him in light gray rectangles with indentations pointing left are the two text messages from his friend, and between them in dark a gray rectangle with an indentation pointing right is Cueball's message.]
Friend (text): I'll be in your city tomorrow if you want to hang out.
Cueball (text): But where will you be if I  want to hang out?!
Friend (text): You know, I just remembered I'm busy.
Why I try not to be pedantic about conditionals.
