Cueball: So what do you want to do?
Friend: Still no ideas.
Cueball: Wait, I think there's a rule about this.
[Cueball goes to bookshelf and removes a book called "Rules".]
[The book of rules is opened to the following:
RULE social.b.99.1
If friends spend more than 60 minutes deciding what to do, they must default to sexual experimentation.]
[Cueball is standing, holding the book. The friend is in the process of standing up.]
Cueball: Huh.
Friend: I did not know that rule.
Cueball: Me neither.
Friend: I'll go get the Crisco.
