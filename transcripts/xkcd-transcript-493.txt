[A dialog between Cueball, seated at a computer terminal, and Black Hat, seated in an armchair reading a book. They are facing away from each other.]
Cueball: I know you shouldn't feed the trolls, but sometimes they just provoke me to where I can't help replying.
Black Hat: Yeah, me too. Yesterday this guy kept spamming "First!", so I got a set of actuarial tables and spent twenty minutes telling him when all his childhood heroes would likely die.
[Cueball turns around in his chair.]
Cueball: ...
Cueball: Remind me never to upset you, ever.
Black Hat: 2038: Last of the original Star Wars cast dies.
Cueball: Augh!
