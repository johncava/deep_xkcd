 That wishing on eyelashes worked
This wish is pointless. If wishing on eyelashes worked, then this would do absolutely nothing (because it already works) and if it didn't then nothing would happen because wishing on eyelashes wouldn't work.
 A pony
This wish functions as a test to see whether or not previous wish worked. It can be assumed that it did, as Black Hat then continued to make additional wishes. Wishing for a pony is a stereotypical wish made by very young girls; since Black Hat is an adult man (with a very dark sense of humor), the contrast is humorous. It could also be a reference to Mr. Krabs wishing for a pony (with saddlebags full of money) on the Spongebob episode "Christmas Who?".
 Unlimited wishes
This appears to have failed, due to the typical ban of wishing for additional wishes in conventional folklore.
 Revocation of rules prohibiting unlimited wishes
An attempt to circumvent the ban in the previous wish. 
 A finite but arbitrarily large number of wishes
Another attempt to circumvent the ban on unlimited wishes.
 The power to dictate the rules governing wishes
Yet another attempt to circumvent the ban on unlimited wishes.
 Unlimited eyelashes
This wish likely caused Black Hat to grow unlimited eyelashes, which could be quite inconvenient and painful. And, yes, one more attempt to circumvent the ban on unlimited wishes.
 That wish-granting entities be required to interpret wishes in accordance with the intent of the wisher
This wish is likely a response to the previous day's misguided wish. It's actually quite a common problem that people making wishes leave them open for misinterpretation.
 That wish-granting entities be incapable of impatience
An attempt to prevent whatever being is powerful enough to grant wishes from becoming angry with Black Hat while he tries to manipulate the system.
 Unlimited breadsticks
The first wish of this day seems to be a reference to the unlimited  offered at .
 Veto power over others' wishes
A power that could be interesting to have. It also very much fits with Black Hat's character.
 Veto power over others' wishes and all congressional legislation
An improvement of the previous wish. This would be very interesting to have indeed, especially if you are Black Hat, because you could veto any federal law, a power normally entrusted only to the President.
 The power to override any veto
This wish would allow Black Hat to override vetoes which in addition to the previous wish would effectively make him control the US legislature and, to some extent, also all other governing bodies.  (Notably the UN, where the veto powers wielded by the "big 5" cannot be overridden and can have large impacts on global politics.) Note that it will not allow him to turn laws off (veto them) and on again (override the veto) at any moment, as once a bill becomes law it cannot be vetoed.  Without the ability to propose legislation, Black Hat's powers are still limited. The wish may also refer back to the February 19 wish: by granting himself veto power over wishes, Black Hat just made vetoes more powerful than wishes; now he is trying to control other people's vetoes as well, lest they one-up him.
 The power to see where any shortened URL goes without clicking
This wish relates to a common practice especially in tweets or other short length media where full length specific HTML addresses such as  would not be feasible. So a more compressed but nonsensical string of seemingly random characters is used which links to a link of the full text address. This creates some problems for people who are security or privacy conscious and prefer to be informed beforehand where they will be traveling on the Internet. The use of shortened URLs is also central to many types of trolls or practical jokes, most notably Rickrolling (see  for an example), by directing someone to a different location than the link would initially suggest. Thus Black Hat might be wishing to be able to tell where the links go for the purpose of avoiding this sort of trolling.
 The power to control the direction news anchors are looking while they talk
This wish likely appeals to Black Hat's mischievous side, allowing him to cause news anchors to look at the wrong camera during live broadcast. Repeatedly switching to the incorrect camera would cause havoc in the studio. Additionally, Black Hat may also attempt to get a news anchor fired by having them stare where they should not such as a female anchor's breasts.
 The power to introduce arbitrary error into Nate Silver's predictions
A reference to , who is a former writer for  working on predicting baseball players' stats and now writes for  in which he predicts the outcome of elections based on polling data. This would grant Black Hat the power to influence the result of elections. This would tighten the Black Hat's control of the US even more.
 A house of stairs
This wish refers to the    by , or perhaps another of his lithographs, 
 A universe which is a replica of this one sans rules against meta-wishes
Another attempt to circumvent the rules against wishing for more wishes.
 Free transportation to and from that universe
While the previous wish appears to have worked, Black Hat notes a problem with it: he is still in our universe with no ways to get to the new one.
 A clear explanation of how wish rules are structured and enforced
It appears that one or both of the previous two wishes failed, so Black Hat tries to discover exactly what is offending the Bureau. Having clear rules and how they work helps anyone finding loopholes in them.
 The power to banish people into the TV show they are talking about
Black hat is obviously fed up of hearing people talking about certain TV shows, and would like to be able to banish them into the show, thus prevent him having to listen to those people. It would be quite horrifying for the person getting banished.
 Zero wishes
An attempt to hack the wish-granting system by using a quite common vulnerability in input validation: an unexpected value. There may be multiple vectors this can work:

However it seems the eyelash wish-granting system does proper input validation on zero because it did not crash or grant unlimited wishes
This wish may also be a reversal of the January 9 wish. Black Hat is attempting to win his game by introducing a logical contradiction: if he gets "zero wishes", this is one wish granted; however, if it is not granted, then, de facto, he will have been granted zero wishes. This is a common technique used in logical proofs to show that an earlier assumption does not hold (in this case, the possibility of eyelash wishing to work).
 Veto power over clocks
Midnight, April 15 is the deadline for filing income tax returns in the United States.
It may also be that Black Hat, now in control of all human legislation, is attempting to extend this to further control also rules of nature -- in this case: time. The strange wording is likely to be due to Black Hat having consulted with the wish-hacking manual he acquired April 2.
