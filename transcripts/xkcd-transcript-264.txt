[She sits back and looks at the monitor.]
[Sheefreshes the page on the computer.]


[She sits back and looks at the monitor.]
[Megan leans forward and clicks the mouse.]

[A hole opens up in the panel. It appears to be the torn paper of the comic itself. A light-blue, sky-like background is revealed. Megan jumps in surprise, nearly tipping over her chair.]
[Megan stands up as the chair falls over completely.]
[Wide view. Megan looks back at the door furtively.]
[She begins to climb into the hole.]
[By now, Megan is entirely inside the hole. She is closing it behind her.]
[Only her head and arms are visible.]
[The hole is closed, revealing a formation of ripped paper.]
[Large frame, where Megan appears to be in space, with blue not black background. Stars dot the sky and rays of light seem to originate from a point to the right, and then traverses the frame both horizontally and vertically almost like lightning. Megan is in a bubble, floating disconnectedly. Both she and the bubble have become white, tinged against the backdrop.]
