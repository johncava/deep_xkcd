[Megan and Cueball are standing, talking to one another.]
Cueball: This weekend, my professor friend built a time machine out of a DeLorean and I went back in time! I helped make sure my parents got together and helped my dad to be less of a loser.
Megan: Wow! Do you still have the time machine?
Cueball: Nah. But I did what I really needed to do.
Megan: Uh huh.
[Neither says anything.]
Megan: Okay, you remember that my father was in the WTC North Tower, right? 
Cueball: Yeah...why?
Megan: I...nothing.
