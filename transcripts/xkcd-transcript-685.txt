A study published in the journal of sexual medicine suggests that the g-spot may not actually exist.
We go live to the researchers' press conference:
[Two reporters with microphones, Ponytail and a Cueball-like guy, stand below a podium where Cueball stands behind a lectern. Ponytail reach out with her microphone towards Cueball:]
Ponytail: Is it true you've been unable to find evidence that the G-spot exists?
[Zoom in on Cueball and the top of the lectern:]
Cueball: My research is in solar cells. I think you have the wrong press conference.
[Beat panel with the same view as before.]
[Same view but now Cueball hangs his head.]
Cueball: But... yes.
