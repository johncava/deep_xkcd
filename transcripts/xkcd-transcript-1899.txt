[Cueball is sitting with his back towards Megan who is lying on her back on a grassy hill. Both are looking up at a sky with small puffy clouds (one large, two small, and four tiny). In the background fields are visible below their vantage point.]
[Same setting, but with the clouds removed, to make room for Cueball's text.]
Cueball: Do you ever just look up at the sky and wonder...
[Same setting, zoomed a bit out to make more of the background fields visible, still with the clouds missing due to the text from the two people.]
Cueball: "What are normal peoples' ears shaped like, that earbuds stay in without falling out?"
Megan: Man, who  what's going on in there.
