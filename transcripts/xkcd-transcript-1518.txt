[The lights have turned on so it is now a white panel with black text. The voice to the right came from Hairy with morning hair. He is leaning over the side of the bed, looking down the air vent through which he has dropped the phone. The other person to the left is not shown. The alarm noise (now coming from the air vent as visualized by the lines coming out of the vent) still continues from the previous panel and continues over the top of the frame directly into the next panel.]
Alarm: 
Off-Screen voice: Make it stop!
Hairy: It... fell down the vent.
[Hairy is sitting in his bed with a laptop. The person to the left is still off-screen. The alarm noise still continues from the previous panel and continues over the top of the frame out of the comic the the right.]
Alarm: 
Off-Screen voice: Can you brick it remotely?
Hairy: Trying... I think I fumbled it into airplane mode?
Off-Screen voice: The battery could last for weeks.
Hairy: You know, maybe we should just move.
