Here, it's combined with elements of other common scary urban legends (phones ringing and creepy laughter) to form something bizarre.
However,  also has a meaning in mathematics. This is indicated in the comic with the soldiers lifting up a giant integral sign to place beside the school, in order to (mathematically) integrate it. Normally, an integral only makes sense on functions; however, since this is the Little Rock , if we take the integral of the constant function () = 9, we do, in fact, get 9 + , as stated in the title text.
The 119 Little Pigs seems to be a variant where the pigs build their houses out of the 118  (and bricks, presumably). The 38th little pig builds his house out of , which is, of course, the 38th element on the Periodic Table. One wonders what happened to the pigs who are stuck making their houses out of elements that are gaseous or liquid at room temperature, or those whose houses would react with the air and/or undergo nuclear decay.
Although given the water content in exhaled breath, it's  how the wolf would huff, puff, and blow down the houses made of , , , , , and . Though making a houses out of , , , , , ,  and  would all be very difficult as they are gases at room temperature. Also, there would be issues such as death from the toxicity of the elements, e.g. fluorine would kill the pig and wolf. The piggies may have difficulty collecting enough metal, as they would have trouble collecting enough  (43), which only occurs in minute traces, and , of which approximately 1 ounce exists on earth. 
It could be a coincidence, or possibly Randall's intent, that the wolf asks "What is this shit?" while referring to strontium while stront is a Dutch word for shit.

Here, Randall takes the pattern to a ridiculous and not-at-all threatening place.
Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends. Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes.
