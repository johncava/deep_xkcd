Regex golf:
[Megan is sitting at a laptop. Cueball is standing behind her.]
Megan: You try to match one group but not the other.
Megan: /m | [tn]|b/ matches  subtitles but not .
Cueball: Cool.
Meta-regex golf:
[A close-up of Megan at her laptop.]
Megan: So I wrote a program that plays regex golf with arbitrary lists...
Cueball (offscreen): Uh oh...
Meta-meta-regex golf:
[Megan typing at her laptop.]
Megan: ...But I lost my code, so I'm grepping for files that look like regex golf solvers.
[Cueball facepalming.]
...And beyond:
[Another closeup of Megan at her laptop.]
Megan: Really, this is all /(meta-)*regex golf/.
Cueball: Now you have  problems.
Megan: No, I had those already.
