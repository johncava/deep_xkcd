[Cueball is sitting at his desk in an office chair pointing to his laptop while looking back over his shoulder talking to Megan off-panel.]
Cueball: Did you see this Boston Dynamics robot video? 
Cueball: We're  all gonna die.
[Megan walks in to the panel towards Cueball who still looks at her, but stops pointing.]
Megan: You know, it's funny. 
Megan: Humans see a robot open a door, and we all instantly assume we're in mortal peril.
[Zoom in on the heads of Megan and Cueball, both now looking at the off-panel screen.]
Megan: So doesn't it make more sense to say the  are all gonna die?
Cueball: Violently overreacting to a perceived threat? That doesn't sound like humans.
Megan: Yeah, I must be thinking of some other species.
[Title Text] Don't be nervous about the robots, be nervous about the people with the resources to build them.
