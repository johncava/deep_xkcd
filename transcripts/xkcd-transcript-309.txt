[Three teams are looking at a counter with two cubes on it. Above it all is written in very large letters:]

[Above the first team consisting of two Cueball-like guys is written the following text (the first line written with larger letters):]

Two non-nerds

Non-nerd 1: Let's get that one.
Non-nerd 2: Okay.
[Above the second team consisting of a Blondie and a Cueball-like guy is written the following text (the first line written with larger letters):]

Non-nerd + nerd

Blondie non-nerd: Let's get that one.
Cueball nerd: Wait, I think that one might be a better deal.
Blondie non-nerd: Okay, that one. 
[Above the third team consisting of two Cueball-like guys is written the following text (the first line written with larger letters):]

Two Nerds

Nerd 1: How about that one?
Nerd 2: I think the other one might be the better deal...
Nerd 1: Hmm, I'm not sure...
[Inside a big arrow pointing straight down:]
Two Hours 
Later
[The two Cueball-like guys are sitting on the floor in front of the counter, both having their laptops open and with lots of paper sheets spread around them, as well as a pen. Blondie from the second team comes in from the right and raises her arms:]
Nerd 1: I think our main problem is our unclear definition of value.
Blondie non-nerd: That is not your main problem!
