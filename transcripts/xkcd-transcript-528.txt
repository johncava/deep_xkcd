[Megan is standing behind Cueball sitting at a desk using his laptop.]
Megan: What are you doing?
Cueball: Trying the Windows 7 beta.
Megan: Why is it showing a picture of Hitler?
[The laptop's screen is shown with Adolf Hitler's face on it, drawn in regular  style.]
Cueball: I don't know. I can't get it to do anything else.
Megan: There's no UI?
Cueball: No, just Hitler.
[Return to the original scene, except Megan is now scratching her head in confusion.]
Megan: Did you try Ctrl-Alt-Delete?
Cueball: It just makes Hitler's eyes flash.
Megan: Huh.
[Scene remains basically the same, except Megan is no longer scratching her head and Cueball is no longer typing on the laptop.]
Megan: Well, it's better than Vista.
Cueball: True.
