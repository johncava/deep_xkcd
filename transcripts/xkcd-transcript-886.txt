This ad is aimed at "crazy cat ladies/bachelors" who compulsively keep a number of animals much greater than is appropriate to the living space.
This is the first repetition of an entry that appears multiple times.  It is also extremely generic, telling the reader little useful about the house. The square house might be a garage, or just a regular square house.  Beside that, most houses have a door in front, there's nothing special about a door.
A strobe light is a very bright light that, instead of remaining on, flashes very quickly. It's frequently used in parties. A constant strobe light and the stated lack of a floor would probably make living in the apartment somewhat difficult.
 This is a post to live as an oarsman on a .  The water and heat presumably both come from the sky, in the form of rain and sunlight.
 This is a completely alien landscape, meant to be unimaginable and maddening. Possibly this represents some "other universe" or an extraterrestrial living space. Clearly this is unlivable, for humans at least.  Short, intense bursts of heat disturb if not kill. Stairs that do not have a clear top or bottom and rooms that can be seen as inside of each other would be confusing and impractical if not impossible to navigate.  Water that runs 'in a sense' is disturbingly vague. Seems to be on a planet with a quick rotation, also close to a star, hence the "short, intense bursts" of heat. 
(Alternatively, the house could have a  inside, which would explain both the 'free heat in short,  intense bursts', along with the 'water that runs in a sense'.) A  is a surface which has no difference between "inside" and "outside", so essentially if you own a Klein bottle all the universe is inside it (and at the same time it is outside). It is physically impossible to build a Klein bottle in a three-dimensional space. A "Klein stair" is possibly a stair connecting a BR to itself. This is why the 2BR in this ad are "one inside the other".
This is a disguised "adult services" (sex) posting, with references to trimmed pubic hair, an attractive body, and a lack of .  Craigslist no longer allows posts for this, because prostitution is illegal in most places in the US.  This post tries to evade the adult services ban by pretending to be something else. "No animals" would normally be assumed to mean "no pets", but in this context probably refers to STDs (possibly  or ) or .
 This  house is an ad for the house in the novel .   It may also refer to the Labyrinth in Ancient Greek mythology.
This is an ad for a residence in the , located near to the town of , in northern Ukraine. The NPP is a 3-level structure, and contains a pool for temporary spent nuclear fuel storage. The rooftop now has plants growing on it after years of neglect, and the glass facade references radioactive glassy minerals created by the explosion. Pripyat was founded in 1970 to serve the power plant, so is only 'historic' in the sense that it is associated with the Chernobyl disaster.
This house is a submarine, as indicated by the advertisement, presumably operated by a navy. The "previous tenants", being members of the armed forces, would undoubtedly resist entry of someone attempting to board their submarine. The sixty bedrooms refers to the crew members' bunks on board the ship, which are in extremely tight quarters and can be very uncomfortable. This may also be a reference to , which makes reference to  stealing a submarine, presumably for  - apparently this is him trying to get rid of it.
 This is an ad for a house in a generic horror movie.
Appearing in the title text, this is a reference to the  in .  is the home planet of , which was obliterated by the Death Star. Mandatory parking references the tractor beams used to drag nearby ships (such as the Millennium Falcon) into the base. The garbage disposal refers to an iconic scene from Star Wars aboard the Death Star involving a garbage disposal. It seems somewhat inconvenient that this "apartment" has over a million bedrooms but only three bathrooms. The guest rooms are probably the detention blocks such as .
