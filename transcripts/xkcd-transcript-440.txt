[Black Hat is driving and Danish who seems to be his equal is in the passenger's seat. They are closely followed by some other vehicle.]
Black Hat: That guy's tailgating me.
Danish: I'll take a look.
[A car is shown to be closely behind Black Hat's car.]
Danish: His laptop's running, probably in the back seat. And... yup, the WiFi autoconnects.
[Close-up of Danish using a laptop.]
Danish: Now we just scan for remote exploits... install speech synth... And take a shot in the psychological dark.
[Cueball's car.]
Laptop: Hello.
Cueball: What? Who's there?
Laptop: She'd be alive if it weren't for you.
Cueball: ...Oh God.
