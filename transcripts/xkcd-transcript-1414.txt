White Hat: Weird- Another study found that kids who use SMS abbreviations actually score  on grammar and spelling tests.
Cueball: Why on  is that a suprise?

Cueball: Imagine kids suddenly start playing catch literally . Everywhere they go, they throw balls back and forth, toss them in the air, and hurl them at trees and signs- Nearly every waking hour of their lives.
[Cueball talks on while White Hat begins to walk.]
Cueball: Do you think their generation will suck at baseball because they learned sloppy skills?
White Hat: ...So you think someone will become a great writer while 
[They walk together.]
Cueball: Have you  James Joyce's love letters? The phrases "My little fuckbird" and "Arse full of farts" appear. If we want to write , our generation may not be sexting .
White Hat: Eww.
