[Rob is working at a workbench. Future-Rob appears out of nowhere with a baseball bat.]
Future-Rob: Hi, Rob.
Rob: Whoa, you're me!
Future-Rob: You're about to have an idea for a time machine.
Rob: I am?
[Future-Rob hits Rob over the head with the baseball bat.]

[Megan approaches Future-Rob working at the workbench, with Rob nowhere to be seen. The baseball bat is stashed behind it.]
Megan: Hey, Rob. What's up?
Future-Rob: Nothing.
This happens somewhere roughly once a month.
