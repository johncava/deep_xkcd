[Caption above the black part of the comic:]
My new language is great, but it 
has a few quirks regarding type:
[The rest of the comic is written in a black rectangle. All text to the left of ">" is written in gray. Text to the right of the ">" on the lines with numbers are in white, and then gray text on the other lines. There seems to be a missing ">" after line no. 3.]
