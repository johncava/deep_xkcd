Cueball: I was trying to figure out why my browser was acting weird.
[In a frame-less panel they keep in walking, Cueball holds both hands up in front of him.]

[Zoom out as Cueball holds up a miniature sword by the blade in one hand. White Hat turns his head around and looks at it while they keep walking.]
Cueball: Anyway, long story short, I found the sword of Martin the Warrior.
White Hat: I think at some point there you switched puzzles.
