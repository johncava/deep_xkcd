[Cueball sits at a desk, while some one off-screen answers his question.]
Cueball: Wait. I should join this honor society to show colleges I'm honorable, and I'm honorable because I'm in an honor society?
Off-screen voice: Basically, yes.
[Close up of Cueball.]
Cueball: Sounds like I could save time by joining the Tautology Club directly.
Off-screen voice: That's not a real club.
Cueball: Then I'm starting it.
[Inserted in a frame crossing the top of the third panels frame is a caption. Cueball is standing on a podium in the right part of the panel speaking. From left to right we find Ponytail, a Cueball-like guy, a short guy with glasses, a buzz cut version of Hairy, a curly haired version of Hairbun with a ponytail and to the right of Cueball, a woman that looks like Megan although with a uncharacteristically white stripe in her hair.]
Caption: Tautology Club:
Ponytail: So how'd you learn about us?
Cueball-like guy: From your Facebook group, "If 1,000,000 People Join This Group, It Will Have 1,000,000 People In It."
Cueball:  The first rule of Tautology Club is the first rule of Tautology Club.
