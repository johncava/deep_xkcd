[Ponytail and her father Cueball are putting away Lego bricks.]
Cueball: When you take apart a Lego house and mix the pieces into the bin, where does the house go?
Ponytail: It's in the bin.
Cueball: No, those are just pieces. They could become spaceships or trains. The house was an arrangement. The arrangement doesn't stay with the pieces and it doesn't go anywhere else. It's just gone.
[Ponytail, older, is standing at a desk. She's holding a couple of Lego bricks.]
[She looks at the bricks.]
[She checks off a box next to the words "Organ Donor" on something on the desk.]
