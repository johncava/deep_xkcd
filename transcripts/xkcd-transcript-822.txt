[A girl is sitting on a bench, reading a book. There is a tree. Far away, Cueball has a backpack on.]
Cueball's thought bubble: There she is. The most beautiful girl you've ever seen.
[The focus is on the girl on the bench.]
Cueball's thought bubble: Every day you take this route to class, she's sitting on that bench, reading.

Cueball's thought bubble: Man, I gotta tell you, I'm SICK of being that guy's internal monologue! So whiny!
Girl's thought bubble: Seriously! I swear, he and Little Miss Daddy Issues over there were  for each other.
[The two look at each other silently.]
