It turns out that, somehow, this will all lead up to a theory that perfectly explains the .
However, it turns out the jury consists only of women, so the "gentlemen" part is not needed. This poses a problem to Cueball's defense, which apparently relied on somewhat sexist tactics. This, sadly, is not too uncommon in real life.
Instead of belief in the Force as in the movie, the "ancient religion" referred to here is actually , a modern pagan religion with two deities that is most notable for practicing magic, and is related to . So, naturally, Darth Vader puts a hex on the commander's family.
The title text notes that modern Wiccans don't really practice the whole "putting hexes on people" thing, which is true. Episcopalianism probably refers to the , which was founded during the American Revolution to replace the Church of England in the colonies.

[A ninja is hiding under a diving board as a man runs along it.]
[The man jumps on the end of the board and hits the ninja in the head, knocking him into the pool.]
[The ninja floats in the water. A bullet passes through the man's head.]

[The man is lying bleeding on the diving board, the ninja is still unconscious on the pool.]
[A sniper is at the top of a hill. The sign in front of the hill says "Grassy Knoll".]
[Someone is pointing at the diagram of the previous panel.]
Off-panel voice: Wait, so  does this have to do with 9/11, again?
Cueball: I  I'm getting there!
[Cueball is studying Megan.]
Cueball: You look different.
Cueball: You have this...  about you.
[They stare in silence.]
[A baby falls out of Megan.]

Megan: Cogito ergo cogito.
Off-panel voice: Playing it safe, huh?
[Two children dressed up as ghosts are standing in front of Megan at a door, each carrying a bag.]
Children: Trick or treat!
[Megan doesn't move.]
Child: Um hi. Why are you just standing there?
Other Child: Candy?
[Another silent panel as the children stare up at Megan.]
[The second child looks in their bag.]
Other Child: Oh God, my bag of candy.
Other Child: It's filling with blood.
Child: We should go.
[A jet is flying across the panel.]
Pilot: Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!
[The pilot and copilot have buckets, and are bailing water out of the cockpit.]
The following is a dramatization of real events.
[Cueball is at a counter, with several jars.]
Cueball: AAAAAAAAAAAAA I'm making a sandwich! AAAAAAAAAA!
[Two people are carrying lightsabers and wearing robes.]
Cueball: Oh God, my eyes won't focus right! And your robe looks... really dirty!
My blacklightsaber was not a success.
[Cueball is standing.]
Cueball: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
Off-screen voice: It seems we happen to be all ladies, actually.
Cueball: ...in that case, this defense is going to appear  ill-advised.
[Darth Vader is sitting between two people, at a table.]
