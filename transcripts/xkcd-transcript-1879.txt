Cueball: I heard that during an eclipse the birds all freak out.
Megan: I guess we'll see!
[Beat panel, the white background sky turns at the top slightly darker.]
[As the sky turns to dusk sounds can be heard. It's written above Cueball and Megan inside squiggly bubbles.]
Chirp Chirp!
Chirp!
Peep peep peep!
Squawk!
[The sky is now nearly dark, more at the top of the panel. The sounds continue, written in similar bubbles.]
Chirp!

The time is upon us!
Peep!

Prepare the blood cauldron!
Cueball: Wow.
Megan: Isn't nature amazing?
