[Megan referring to a published article she is holding.]
Megan: I found this article on the linguistics of the "Quotative Like".
Cueball: Like, when you're like, "She was like"?
Megan: Yeah.
Megan: It features a quote from a linguist, Patricia Cukor-Avila: "Eventually all the people who hate this kind of thing are going to be dead, and the ones who use it are going to be in control."
Cueball: Wow. Turns out linguists are pretty hardcore.
Megan: I  she means dead from old age.
Cueball: I'm gonna start using "like" more, just in case.
