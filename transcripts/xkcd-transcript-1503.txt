[There are three squirrels.  One is suspended from a balloon. The other two are sitting on the ground, looking up at it.]
Squirrel to the right: Once you've chewed a hole in the sun, shoot the balloon to fall back to earth, then pull the parachute ripcord to land.
Squirrel tied to balloon: Are you  it's full of acorns?
Squirrel to the right: Look how bright and magnificent it is! What  could be in there?
