[Black Hat is sitting with his laptop on a desk when Cueball, standing behind him, looks up on the wall and asks him about the large digital countdown timer with red numbers which is hanging high up on the wall. It has a white frame around the black display with the red numbers. Most of the left part of the counter is covered by a framed picture which hangs on a string attached to a nail above the counter. The picture depicts either a setting sun reflecting in an ocean, or an exploding volcano with lava flowing away from it. The picture does not block the left most part of the frame around the counter, and it is also possible to see the two left-most lines of the first digit on the countdown, so they are both turned on. This proves that the numbers goes all the way to the left end. The next five digits are covered by the picture. Then one digit is only partly covered, as only the two most left lines are not visible. From the visible lines it is though clear that this digit shows a 0. The next seven digits are fully visible, giving eight discernible digits.]
Cueball: What's that?
Black Hat: Countdown.
[Same picture, but Cueball is looking at Black Hat. The counter counts down.]
Cueball: To what?
Black Hat: Supervolcano, I think. I forget which one.
[Cueball looks up again for about 18s (between 2nd and fourth image) - beat panel.]
[Cueball looks at Black Hat again.]
Cueball: Maybe we should move that picture?
Black Hat: Too hard to reach. It's probably fine.
