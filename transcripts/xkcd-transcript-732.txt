[Cueball is pointing to a huge flatscreen HDTV on the wall. His friend is holding a cell phone.]
Cueball (HDTV Owner): Check out my new HDTV-a beautiful, high-def 1080p.
Friend: Wow, that's over  the horizontal resolution of my cell phone.
Friend: In fact, it almost beats the LCD monitor I got in 2004.
It baffles me that people find HDTV impressive.
