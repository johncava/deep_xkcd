[Cueball sits at a desk, looking at a laptop screen with one hand on his chin.]
Cueball: So I thought I found your porn folder, in calendar/backup/PORN
Friend (off screen): Don't open that!
[A wider shot of the person looking at the laptop.]
Cueball: But it contains a bunch more folders, filled with more folders, and then... after 20 levels, somehow I'm back at the main folder?
Friend (off screen): It's, uh, well hidden.
[Cueball has turned around in the chair, now with the laptop in his lap.]
Cueball: I think there's no actual porn here.
Cueball: You're just turned on by filesystems.
Friend (off screen): It's a hardlinked directory loop - so taboo!
Cueball: Now I feel dirty sharing a drive with you.
