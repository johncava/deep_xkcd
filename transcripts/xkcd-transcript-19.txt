"I count the moments we're apart. And add them up mathematically 
and multiply them by the kisses supposedly I've been missing. 
Divided by the attention not to mention the affection. 
Subtract that from your gross potential and see I ain't missin' none. 

I take the square root and get boxed in every time. 
When I know the shortest distance between two points is in a straight line.
