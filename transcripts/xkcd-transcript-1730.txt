Megan: What do you mean?
Ponytail: Like, if I Kickstart a starshade for them?
Megan: Um. Would you at least  them?
Ponytail: Eh. Whatever.
[Cueball and Hairbun, both wearing headsets, are sitting on one legged stools on either side of a slim desk with two computers screens on top of it. Each are looking at their own screens while typing on a keyboard in front of them. Hairbun is pointing at her screen. A small frame is overlaid on the top of the panels frame with a caption:]
