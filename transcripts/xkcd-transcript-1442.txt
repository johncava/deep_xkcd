[The symbol for hydrogen.]
Hydrogen can form four bonds. It readily bonds with itself, and often exists as a crystal.
[A diagram with several 'H's is shown. The 'H's are connected in a pattern like a crystal.]
Crystalline hydrogen
[The symbol for carbon.]
Carbon can only form two bonds. It readily bonds with hydrogen to form CH (mydrane) or itself.
[Two diagrams, one with two 'C's connected together and the other with two 'C's and one 'H' connected.]
[The symbol for oxygen.]
Oxygen is inert, forming no bonds...
[A diagram of several 'O's is shown. None are connected to anything.]
Monoatomic oxygen gas.
